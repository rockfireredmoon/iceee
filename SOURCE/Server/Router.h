// The Router has only one primary function, to send a string containing the 
// address and port of the Simulator once a connection has been established.
// (ex:   192.168.1.10:4000)
// What it needs to do:
//   - Open a listening socket on the required ports.  (4241 or 4242 are the router ports)
//   - Once a connection is established, send the response string.
//   - Close the connection.  This signals the client to open a connection to the
//     simulator using the address it just received.
//   - Return to the first step to handle any further connection attempts.
//
// Each Router port will be divided into a separate thread.  This is because the
// receiving function will halt the thread until a connection is made,
// and multiple threads are required for multiple ports to work simultaneously.
// Separate threads are also required so it doesn't interfere with the running loop
// of the main thread, which is responsible for managing the windows, updating
// information and taking user input.
//
// Each thread will contain its own copy of the response data so that the data
// sections do not overlap.
