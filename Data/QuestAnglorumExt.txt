Title=Travel to Ironstone Watch
BodyText=Hail hero! I have heard of your deeds both here in Anglorum and abroad. Indeed, King Arthur himself has said many great things about you!

Once again, your skills are needed for another task in our fair land. We here in Castle Camelot recently received word from Ironstone Watch, located to the southwest of Stonehenge, that all is not well over there. I would ask you to travel to Ironstone Watch and speak with the current watchkeeper Shelby Marsh. She will surely update you on the situation. The King would send reinforcements there himself, but, with the stirrings of Avalon in recent times, we dare not spread ourselves thin.

Please, on behalf of the people of Anglorum I ask you to take this task.
CompleteText=Hail friend and welcome to Ironstone Watch!

Title=The Ironstone Quarry
BodyText=In your travels down to this part of Anglorum, you might have noticed the ground, along with the temperature, in this area begin to abruptly change. Where the rest of Anglorum enjoys the changing of the seasons that bring with them heat, rain, and snow, the region of southwestern Anglorum known as Ironstone, named so because of the durable stone that was once quarried there, is covered in ice and snow all year round. I can assure you this is by no means a natural phenomenon.

Long ago when the quarries were still active, the climate of Ironstone was much different than it is now and was pretty much the same as the rest of Anglorum. Following a catastrophe, however, the temperature began to rapidly cool and everything began to freeze. The beasts of Anglorum abandoned Ironstone and fled for their lives northward...though not simply because of the climate change.

Deep in a cave in the far southwesternmost peninsula of Ironstone, quarriers uncovered a slumbering beast, a dragon if you can believe it - that apparently had been buried for an untold amount of years. Disturbed by those excavating the stone, the beast awakened one day and completely laid waste to the entre area. It was this dragon, who has been given the moniker Grimfrost, that forced the beasts to abandon Ironstone.

This outpost, dubbed the Ironstone Watch, was constructed soon after Grimfrost returned to her slumber as a means of monitoring the area for any sign she might become active again.

In the meantime, the old quarries, now long ago abandoned, have become infested with monsters. If that wasn't enough, a strange group of Yeti have settled in the now frozen landscape. Calling themselves 'The Brood of Grimfrost', these 'Beasts', if you could call them such, seem to worship the dragon. There are even reports that claim they believe themselves to be the very offspring of that horrid beast! What utter nonsense! Worse, though, it seems these 'Brood of Grimfrost' yeti have become active. They have been organizing of late and moving north, even to the very edge of the snow cover, where, even here in the Watch, we can see them from a distance. That can mean only one thing - the dragon, itself, may very well be awake again.

If you indeed wish to assist us in our work here, then here is your first task. Eliminate as many of those accursed 'Brood' yeti off of Gaia's earth as you can. By thinning their numbers, perhaps their threat can be greatly reduced.
CompleteText=Excellent work, but, I assure you there is more to be done here.

Title=The Frostbound Djinn
BodyText=While the Grimfrost Brood yeti are indeed strong, there is a much worse foe that has also settled in the shadow of Grimfrost's mountain cave. Where they came from is not known; however, what is known, is that soon after Ironstone was turned to frost and ice, a group of djinn soon migrated in. Lead by a powerful djinn named Al'zahrazzi, these Frostbound Marid djinn proved to be quite fearsome. Unafraid of the sleeping dragon, the Frostbound Marids have not only laid claim to the long abandoned quarries closest to Grimfrost's cave, but, they have also taken to living within the lair itself! While we cannot confirm an alliance with the Grimfrost Brood yeti, we also cannot allow these djinn to infest Anglorum.

Thus, your next task is to eliminate as many of the Frostbound Marid djinn infesting the quarries as possible. With their numbers diminished, they would hopefully choose not to press the issue further.
CompleteText=You were successful? You are indeed strong, yet the most difficult task remains.

Title=Grimfrost's Lair
BodyText=I have already spoken to you regarding the dragon Grimfrost and her followers and of the Djinn who have come to infest Ironstone. Now I ask of you to take on the most difficult task yet.

To truly bring an end to these threats, I ask of you to enter Grimfrost's Lair in the mountains on the southwestern peninsula and defeat the leader of the djinn Al'zahrazzi. With him eliminated, the remaining Frostbound djinn should become more disorganized and easier to take care of.

Once you have removed Al'zahrazzi as a threat, head deeper into the heart of the cave and find the resting place of Grimfrost herself. So long as that ancient dragon remains living, all of Anglorum is in peril. You must find her resting place and make certain she never again walks Gaia's earth! For this most harrowing of tasks, I would suggest taking friends with you. May your blade strike true!
CompleteText=Hero, you have returned safely! Gaia be praised! Words cannot express the gratitude of the people of Anglorum this day! Not only have you averted a possible disaster, but, you have made the entire region safer as well. Please, accept one of these gifts as well as my eternal thanks. Farewell!

He will know how best to proceed in these matters.
CompleteText=Hail and well met once again Hero! Your reputation precedes you as always.

What's this? A message from South Shield? ... ... This is indeed terrible news.

If our problems with Avalon and the Shadow Legion on our doorsteps was not grim enough, now we must deal with this new Faerie threat as well.

*sigh*

Again I must thank you for bringing this to my attention, Hero. Rest assured, I will send what aid I can muster to South Shield to assist in the defenses of Hadrian's Wall. The Faerie must not be allowed to enter our fair land once more!

In the meantime, I believe my Queen has an offer for you as well.

May Gaia be with you, Hero.

Title=The King's Tunnel
BodyText=Greetings from Camelot, Hero of Anglorum! Like my husband, I have heard the tales of your deeds here and abroad and it is an honor to finally have the chance to speak with you.

In fact, I now carry information that may be of interest to you.

We in Anglorum value our allies over on the main continent and do what we can to tighten relations between us whenever possible. It was for this reason I thought of you when a friend of mine who hails from Baffle Gate in the Midlands, sent me word that they are looking for anyone with a taste for adventure. Knowing Reni, though, he would not have bothered me with this sort of information unless there was particular need for such individuals in his homeland.

I have already discussed his request at length with Arthur and he has agreed that just as you have done much for us here in Anglorum, perhaps you can do much for those on the main continent as well. We have already sent word ahead to our guards who defend the Chunnel to the southeast of Camelot to grant the Hero of Anglorum passage to mainland Europe.

What is the Chunnel? The Chunnel is a large tunnel that connects Anglorum to the main continent. Legend claims the ancient passage was constructed during the Age of Man and that it was destroyed during Man's fall. The tunnel was considered lost until enterprising Beasts from Anglorum found and excavated it long ago. It has since been in the care of Anglorum royalty and we consider the Chunnel a valuable asset when sending emissaries to our allies on the mainland and receiving theirs in turn. Because the kings of Anglorum have laid claim to the Chunnel, it is often given the moniker, 'The King's Tunnel' by travelers from abroad.

When you reach Baffle Gate, find my friend Reni Sparda and tell him I have sent you to the Midlands in reply to his petition.

Go now to the Midlands, Hero and Gaia be with you in your travels.
CompleteText=Hello there and welcome to Baffle Gate!

Yes, I am Reni Sparda.

...a message from the Queen?

...so the Lady Guinevere sent you personally?

You must be a great adventurer to have caught the attentions of Camelot, friend! As a matter of fact, your timing could not be more perfect! Hurry over to Mayor Hoffbeast up on the hill over there. He will fill you in if you truly seek adventure here in the Midlands as well.
