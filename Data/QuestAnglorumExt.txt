Title=Travel to Ironstone Watch
BodyText=Hail hero! I have heard of your deeds both here in Anglorum and abroad. Indeed, King Arthur himself has said many great things about you!

Once again, your skills are needed for another task in our fair land. We here in Castle Camelot recently received word from Ironstone Watch, located to the southwest of Stonehenge, that all is not well over there. I would ask you to travel to Ironstone Watch and speak with the current watchkeeper Shelby Marsh. She will surely update you on the situation. The King would send reinforcements there himself, but, with the stirrings of Avalon in recent times, we dare not spread ourselves thin.

Please, on behalf of the people of Anglorum I ask you to take this task.
CompleteText=Hail friend and welcome to Ironstone Watch!

Title=The Ironstone Quarry
BodyText=In your travels down to this part of Anglorum, you might have noticed the ground, along with the temperature, in this area begin to abruptly change. Where the rest of Anglorum enjoys the changing of the seasons that bring with them heat, rain, and snow, the region of southwestern Anglorum known as Ironstone, named so because of the durable stone that was once quarried there, is covered in ice and snow all year round. I can assure you this is by no means a natural phenomenon.

Long ago when the quarries were still active, the climate of Ironstone was much different than it is now and was pretty much the same as the rest of Anglorum. Following a catastrophe, however, the temperature began to rapidly cool and everything began to freeze. The beasts of Anglorum abandoned Ironstone and fled for their lives northward...though not simply because of the climate change.

Deep in a cave in the far southwesternmost peninsula of Ironstone, quarriers uncovered a slumbering beast, a dragon if you can believe it - that apparently had been buried for an untold amount of years. Disturbed by those excavating the stone, the beast awakened one day and completely laid waste to the entre area. It was this dragon, who has been given the moniker Grimfrost, that forced the beasts to abandon Ironstone.

This outpost, dubbed the Ironstone Watch, was constructed soon after Grimfrost returned to her slumber as a means of monitoring the area for any sign she might become active again.

In the meantime, the old quarries, now long ago abandoned, have become infested with monsters. If that wasn't enough, a strange group of Yeti have settled in the now frozen landscape. Calling themselves 'The Brood of Grimfrost', these 'Beasts', if you could call them such, seem to worship the dragon. There are even reports that claim they believe themselves to be the very offspring of that horrid beast! What utter nonsense! Worse, though, it seems these 'Brood of Grimfrost' yeti have become active. They have been organizing of late and moving north, even to the very edge of the snow cover, where, even here in the Watch, we can see them from a distance. That can mean only one thing - the dragon, itself, may very well be awake again.

If you indeed wish to assist us in our work here, then here is your first task. Eliminate as many of those accursed 'Brood' yeti off of Gaia's earth as you can. By thinning their numbers, perhaps their threat can be greatly reduced.
CompleteText=Excellent work, but, I assure you there is more to be done here.

Title=The Frostbound Djinn
BodyText=While the Grimfrost Brood yeti are indeed strong, there is a much worse foe that has also settled in the shadow of Grimfrost's mountain cave. Where they came from is not known; however, what is known, is that soon after Ironstone was turned to frost and ice, a group of djinn soon migrated in. Lead by a powerful djinn named Al'zahrazzi, these Frostbound Marid djinn proved to be quite fearsome. Unafraid of the sleeping dragon, the Frostbound Marids have not only laid claim to the long abandoned quarries closest to Grimfrost's cave, but, they have also taken to living within the lair itself! While we cannot confirm an alliance with the Grimfrost Brood yeti, we also cannot allow these djinn to infest Anglorum.

Thus, your next task is to eliminate as many of the Frostbound Marid djinn infesting the quarries as possible. With their numbers diminished, they would hopefully choose not to press the issue further.
CompleteText=You were successful? You are indeed strong, yet the most difficult task remains.

BodyText=I have already spoken to you regarding the dragon Grimfrost and her followers and of the Djinn who have come to infest Ironstone. Now I ask of you to take on the most difficult task yet.

To truly bring an end to these threats, I ask of you to enter Grimfrost's Lair in the mountains on the southwestern peninsula and defeat the leader of the djinn Al'zahrazzi. With him eliminated, the remaining Frostbound djinn should become more disorganized and easier to take care of.

Once you have removed Al'zahrazzi as a threat, head deeper into the heart of the cave and find the resting place of Grimfrost herself. So long as that ancient dragon remains living, all of Anglorum is in peril. You must find her resting place and make certain she never again walks Gaia's earth! For this most harrowing of tasks, I would suggest taking friends with you. May your blade strike true!
CompleteText=Hero, you have returned safely! Gaia be praised! Words cannot express the gratitude of the people of Anglorum this day! Not only have you averted a possible disaster, but, you have made the entire region safer as well. Please, accept one of these gifts as well as my eternal thanks. Farewell!

What's this? A message from South Shield? ... ... This is indeed terrible news.

If our problems with Avalon and the Shadow Legion on our doorsteps was not grim enough, now we must deal with this new Faerie threat as well.

*sigh*

Again I must thank you for bringing this to my attention, Hero. Rest assured, I will send what aid I can muster to South Shield to assist in the defenses of Hadrian's Wall. The Faerie must not be allowed to enter our fair land once more!

In the meantime, I believe my Queen has an offer for you as well.

May Gaia be with you, Hero.

Title=The King's Tunnel
BodyText=Greetings from Camelot, Hero of Anglorum! Like my husband, I have heard the tales of your deeds here and abroad and it is an honor to finally have the chance to speak with you.

In fact, I now carry information that may be of interest to you.

We in Anglorum value our allies over on the main continent and do what we can to tighten relations between us whenever possible. It was for this reason I thought of you when a friend of mine who hails from Baffle Gate in the Midlands, sent me word that they are looking for anyone with a taste for adventure. Knowing Reni, though, he would not have bothered me with this sort of information unless there was particular need for such individuals in his homeland.

I have already discussed his request at length with Arthur and he has agreed that just as you have done much for us here in Anglorum, perhaps you can do much for those on the main continent as well. We have already sent word ahead to our guards who defend the Chunnel to the southeast of Camelot to grant the Hero of Anglorum passage to mainland Europe.

What is the Chunnel? The Chunnel is a large tunnel that connects Anglorum to the main continent. Legend claims the ancient passage was constructed during the Age of Man and that it was destroyed during Man's fall. The tunnel was considered lost until enterprising Beasts from Anglorum found and excavated it long ago. It has since been in the care of Anglorum royalty and we consider the Chunnel a valuable asset when sending emissaries to our allies on the mainland and receiving theirs in turn. Because the kings of Anglorum have laid claim to the Chunnel, it is often given the moniker, 'The King's Tunnel' by travelers from abroad.

When you reach Baffle Gate, find my friend Reni Sparda and tell him I have sent you to the Midlands in reply to his petition.

Go now to the Midlands, Hero and Gaia be with you in your travels.
CompleteText=Hello there and welcome to Baffle Gate!

Yes, I am Reni Sparda.

...a message from the Queen?

...so the Lady Guinevere sent you personally?

You must be a great adventurer to have caught the attentions of Camelot, friend! As a matter of fact, your timing could not be more perfect! Hurry over to Mayor Hoffbeast up on the hill over there. He will fill you in if you truly seek adventure here in the Midlands as well.

Title=Putting the Dead to Rest
BodyText=Hello again, friend. If you really are going to enter the Crypt to deal with the Thornbringers and Jengal, perhaps you can perform an additional task as well?

I am quite certain Lunast himself would agree with me on this, but, while eliminating the source of this madness and the one behind it is all well and good, there is still the matter of dealing with those their foul magic has reawakened along with those helping Jengal.

What I am requesting of you is to work your way through the side passages of the Crypt that flank the central passage. Somewhere within these catacombs you will find old King Wilhelm along with two notable members of his famed Court who have long been interred with him. Your task is to find each one and return them to their eternal slumber. In addition to these, you are quite likely to find the locations of Jengal's two accomplices in this act of desecration. I want you to eliminate both of them so that this abomination is not continued.

Be warned, as you take on this task! Both King Wilhelm and his Courtiers are said to have been very powerful Beasts in life. It is entirely possible that the dark magics used to reawaken them have also at least partially restored the strength they once had. Take the necessary precautions when doing battle against them.

In addition, be wary when dealing with Jengal's two accomplices while making your way through the passages. Lorna's scout mentioned one is named Marlon Wilber, a powerful Sage that is in all likelihood the one responsible for translating for Jengal the words from that book you brought to Lorna earlier. He is quite likely also the one who created the power source for Jengal as well. With him gone, this knowledge will hopefully be lost to the Thornbringers and they will be much harder pressed to utilize their evil magics in the desecration of other tombs allowing the souls resting in those places to hopefully remain at rest.

The other is the leader of sorts of the Thornbringers' Templar factions within the Crypt which would make him quite formidable. The scout said his name is Cornelius and he is probably the one directly responsible for the grave desecrations in the Crypt. Eliminating him should put a damper on their efforts to disturb those resting there.

Here is a list of notes I made using some of the information obtained from the report given by Lorna's scout regarding both matters. It will aid you in locating the King's courtiers along with King Wilhelm himself. I have included some additional details about each taken from records held within the Camelot Great Library. Notes regarding Jengal's two accomplices are also included.

Now go quickly! Once you have returned Wilhelm and his courtiers to Gaia's embrace and eliminated both of Jengal's accomplices from the world of the living, return to me.
CompleteText=Praise Gaia you have returned alive from that horrible place! Were you successful?

More things to praise the Earthmother for then! Allow me to thank you for everything you have done here. Gaia's blessings be upon you, friend!

Act.BodyText=According to the notes given to you by Druid Felina, two notable members of King Wilhelm's court have been raised along with him:

Kerrath Bellington, Royal Assassin and Spy to the King
Commander Adalhelm, Captain of King Wilhelm's Royal Guard

Felina has bothered to include basic directions for locating both of Wilhelm's courtiers along with the likely locations of Jengal's two accomplices. Her directions indicate the Thornbringers have split their forces evenly between the sections of the Crypt with each of Jengal's accomplices taking control of an entire wing. Felina suggests tackling the South Wing section first before moving to the North Wing.

Her notes also suggest that Templar Cornelius was last seen by Lorna's scout wandering the South Wing among the various tombs there. Use this information to find Cornelius and take him out.

The tomb of Kerrath Bellington is also likely located in the South Wing section, but further in where those of darker trades were said to have been laid to rest. Expect to find Kerrath in one of these deeper chambers.

Do as Felina has asked and send both of them to Gaia's embrace.

According to Felina, the one responsible for translating words from the book 'Quod Occultus Lingua' for Jengal Narglor and creating the power source is a powerful Sage named Marlon Wilber.

Felina's notes mention that Lorna's scout spotted him in a room in the North Wing that the Thornbringers have fashoned into a sort of library. Apparently Marlon Wilber prefers to study alone when his assistants are not around. Use this information to find and eliminate him.

The tomb of Commander Adalhelm is also located in the North Wing section of the crypt. He can probably be found in one of the chambers where the fallen members of the King's army were known to have been laid to rest.

Do as Felina has asked and send these two into Gaia's embrace as well!

Act.BodyText=According to Felina's notes, old King Wilhelm was said to have been interred in a lavish sarcophagus befitting royalty of his caliber. His tomb is located in the deepest portions of the Crypt's North Wing section so that is the likely place to find him.

The notes also mention that King Wilhelm himself was a powerful mage in his own right, his magical prowess considered to be among the strongest of his day.

Unlike his courtiers or Jengal's accomplices, sending Wilhelm to Gaia's embrace will be no easy task, so take the necessary precautions!

Title=Delivery To Nottingham
BodyText=Say friend, before you go, perhaps you can do one last thing for Sned and myself? You see we have this gent up in Nottingham on the eastern end of the Sherwood Forest to the north who Sned often goes to when it is time to take our grown foods to market there. He gives us a good deal, though I have heard tell things are not well in Nottingham of late.

None of our business anyway, really. We are just farmers trying to make a living between there and Camelot after all. This last time, though, Ferris went above and beyond our asking price on our last trip to Market. Sned felt we should offer him something in thanks for his generosity under the circumstances.

Would you do us farmers this favor and take this crate of fresh vegetables to Ferris MacMillan in Nottingham and inform him that we are very grateful for the extra service received during our last trip up that way and that the vegetables are a gift? Both Sned and I would be grateful for this favor. I would go myself but the fields need tending. Please say you will.
CompleteText=Welcome to Nottingham, traveler. Is there something I can help you with?

This crate of vegetables is from Farmer Sned over at Tall Grass Farm? How much do I owe him?

...a gift? Oh no no, this will not do! If the Sheriff or his deputies find out I have taken supplies without due payment for them I could be arrested!

No, this is not Sned or Hughes' faults. They both mean well, I understand this and I do appreciate the gesture.

Tell you what, friend. Since you have gone through all this trouble to deliver this crate to me on their behalf, I will pay you for the goods in their stead. The Sheriff's deputies are less likely to take action so long as money has been exchanged and this way Sned's gift is preserved as technically I would be paying you for the package delivery anyway.

Here, this amount of coin should be enough to cover the cost. Do me this favor and please do not tell either Sned or Hughes about this. I do not wish to burden them with our town's troubles. Thank you again friend and please take care while in town.
