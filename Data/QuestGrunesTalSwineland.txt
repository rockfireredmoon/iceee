Title=Speak with the Captain
BodyText=Hmm... Yes, I see... Old Ironbirch was wise to have this taken out of the hands of those Khazechek fools in the Deadwood. Had their plans to 'summon' up the object of their worship succeeded, I fear the Deadwood would be facing a far more formidable foe than merely the reborn Khazekeela or indeed the Pact of Decay itself. You see, this is, as you were told, indeed not the hand of that witch; but is in fact, the hand of a powerful Lich that once roamed the countrysides of Grunes Tal. We Redeemers managed to destroy this Lich years ago and it was thought no further harm would come from him. This hand's existance proves that is sadly not the case. How the Khazechek found this thing is not important. What IS important is that you have procured it from them before something terrible happened.

For years my family have been experts on the handling of the Undead and we have learned various ways of purifying and disposing of various objects related to them. As such, I shall take the Lich's hand and see what can be done to destroy it. Though, there is the chance darker forces are involved. If this is the case, merely destroying this thing would be just the beginning.

In the meantime, friend, as you have probably noticed we at Redeemer's Hall are at constant odds with the Undead threat here in Grunes Tal. If you would like to join in our fight to halt the advance of the Legions of Sheol, please talk to Captain Zaris, he is the officer in charge here at the Hall. Any assistance in the fight against Abidan's forces is always welcome.
CompleteText=Speak up! Huh, so Hans sent you did he.

Title=Caretakers of the Lanterns
BodyText=Friend! Yes, you there! If you are headed out to the farms around Shadowfield would you be willing to perform a task for us as well? You see, we are... how to say... the 'lanternkeepers' of Grunes Tal. It is a largely thankless job and a dangerous one as well! Simply put, we are in charge of maintaining the lanterns that can be found all along the roads of Grunes Tal and here at the Hall and making certain they are kept lit. While this doesn't exactly drive off the hordes of Undead, it DOES serve to keep our paths visible; especially when traveling during the night.

As for your task? Yes, well, you see... over the long years, it was discovered that the glowing iridescence within the eyes of the local Spiteful Lanterneyes lit up the night rather well. Further research discovered that this iridescence was to be found within the fluid in the eyes. Over time, some of us Redeemers found a way to preserve this fluid so that it could be used as a source of natural light. Every few months to a year or so, we go out and hunt the Lanterneyes for their eye fluid until we have a good size supply to last us for a good while. Once again, our stores of Lanterneye Eye Fluid has begun to run low and unfortunately, due to the recent activity in the area, we have been unable to go out and collect the fluid ourselves.

This is where you come in! All we ask is that you gather a good... let's say...fifteen...yes, fifteen vials of fluid sounds good enough... of the eye fluid from the Spiteful Lanterneyes. Once you have them, return to me and I shall pay you a fair sum for the lot.
CompleteText=You have the vials of Eye Fluid! Friend, if only you knew how much time you have spared us in our already thankless task here in these dark lands. As promised, here is your reward and our thanks for your help.

BodyText=The Lady Jana Burnfell was very effective with her curse against the Outcasts, causing generations of infertility and an almost-dead race. What you will note here in Grunes Tal is that we have the largest population of Outcasts you will ever encounter - just step outside Redeemer's Hall and you will be greeted with undead, many of which were alive at the time of the Burnfells.

Forget your notions of shuffling zombies, and remember that these are conniving predators. It will help keep you alive!

We have questioned a few unlucky enough to have been captured, and discovered that they are now laboring under Abidan to construct a Behemoth - a massive zombie constructed of spare parts.

We have nothing to defend against this - unless we construct a behemoth of our own!

There are three camps west of here, inhabited by several types of zombies: Limb-Cullers, Organ-Cullers, and Bone-Cullers. We know that Abidan is grooming these particular undead for their "good parts" to construct a Behemoth.

Travel to these undead camps, and harvest ten each of used limbs, organs and bones from the Organ-Cullers, Bone-Cullers and Limb-Cullers.

We will not only hinder Abidan's efforts, but may create a powerful ally in the process!
CompleteText=Yes, these will do nicely! Excellent work.

I would send you within the Folkirk Manor itself, to eliminate an ancient Beast family so evil, I believe that they were not turned by any invading zombie to their home. Instead, their dust-filled veins simply took on their true forms when the undead invvaded!

Enter the Manor, friend, and have no fear of the sort of parlour tricks, tickling spiders or creaking doorways  within. Focus on the family Folkirk and eliminate their existance from Gaia's sight! Search for the Uncle Moldyfork, Father Grundy, Mother Cruella and their little dog too! Scraps, I think, is the name of their killer hound. 
CompleteText=So those vile Folkirks have finally met the end they so long ago deserved? That is good news indeed.

Title=The Shadowfield
BodyText=While our main duties are to stem the tide of the Vampire Palatine Drakul's forces which have already reached deep into Swineland to the northeast, those of us stationed here have a secondary duty to beastkind. Here, deep in the heart of Grunes Tal, we have long held back the advancing forces of Abidan which have spilled out of the UnderRealm and laid waste to this entire region.

Grunes Tal was once a thriving mining region that prospered through the ores excavated from the mountains here. Chief among the towns that grew wealthy from the ore was Alpenhold. The iron mines of Alpenhold were said to be among the largest in the region and the city became a famous centre of trade.

Unfortunately, this attracted our old foes the Outcasts which set off a series of conflicts today known simply as 'The Outcast Wars'. For years, the beasts of Grunes Tal staved off the Outcasts to protect their mines and wealth; however, little did they know, a much greater threat would soon cast its shadow upon the land.



It happened in the largest of the mines in the Iron Hills situated to the east near Alpenhold itself. As the miners delved ever deeper into the earth seeking that which made their people rich, they eventually broke through into a previously unknown cavern deep underground.

Curiosity overcoming caution, the miners began to explore this newly discovered cavern. Finding nothing save that it stretched on and on, they returned to the surface to report what they had discovered.



Unbeknownst to those unfortunate miners, the cavern they had dug into led into the UnderRealm itself. Before long, the agents of Abidan began to pour forth out of the mine, quickly surrounding Alpenhold. All efforts to hold them back failed and, eventually, the great city of Alpenhold fell to the onslaught of the Legions of Sheol.

The survivors who fled the Undead assault retreated west to the fertile lands of the Greenfeld, occupied by both Beast and Outcast alike.  A few notable families, unfortunately, were stubborn in their ways and refused to give up on Alpenhold. Among those families was the now-infamous House of Folkirk. The Folkirks, a wealthy noble family, refused to relocate far from Alpenhold and instead headed north, settling on a hill just south of the Junderlund where they built their new home, Folkirk Manor.

For a number of years, the beasts of the Greenfeld struggled between fighting the Undead threat that continued to spread throughout Grunes Tal and the Outcasts who still remained in the region.

Unfortunately, it was only a matter of time before the Undead gained enough strength to overcome even the strongest defenses. Around two hundred years past, the Legions of Sheol finally overwhelmed the people living in the Greenfeld and neither Beast nor Outcast got far before falling before the Undead might. Before long, those that did not flee to the neighboring lands were killed.

In these final days of prosperity, Redeemer's Hall was built by some of our members who had been sent West to aid the people of Grunes Tal and it soon became the final bastion of beast life within Grunes Tal. Even today, we, the Redeemers, have done our utmost to make certain the Legions of Sheol have been unable to fully invade other Beast lands still largely untouched by Abidan's forces. As for the Greenfeld, it has become darkened and is now known as the Shadowfield named so in testament to the many losses incurred there.

Now friend, if you truly wish to aid our forces, then here your first task.

Northwest of here lies what was once Greenfeld City. Now called Shadowfield City, it is inhabited by the unliving remains of those who were there when it fell. South of the city there is a series of farms whose undead residents still roam the land. Your task is to open the road by eliminating Taskmaster Glutt. As his name suggests, he is leader of the Farmhands that still tend the farms. Recent intel suggests he has been recently organizing them for a much more sinister purpose and so we want him taken out. While you are there, eliminate a dozen of those Farmhands as well. Without Glutt to lead them, the Farmhands should prove to be easy targets. Return to me with the Taskmaster's Spade as proof that these deeds have been carried out and I will see to it that you are rewarded for your efforts.
CompleteText=Excellent work! Without Glutt to lead them and their numbers thinned a bit, the remaining Farmhands should be more disorganized and easy to pick off. As promised, here is your reward.

BodyText=Now that Glutt is out of the way, we can move on Shadowfield itself. Be warned though, that the city will not be taken so easily. Stationed within the city is a warrior with a tragic story.

General Bodiccea was once a warrior of great reknown and a highly respected beast. 

Legend has it Bodiccea and her troops were able to hold back the Undead for several years before this region fell to their onslaught. Her last stand was in Greenfeld City, now called Shadowfield, where she and her forces fought to the last beast while the citizens were evacuated. The story goes that after several days of battle, the Undead finally infiltrated the city and slaughtered all who remained, including Bodiccea and her troops. Even in death, Bodiccea was not to be deterred and she continues to guard the Shadowfield to this very day.

While her cause in life was selfless and noble, Bodiccea and her troops now fight mindlessly, forever trapped in bodies long since robbed of life. 

Your task is to enter Shadowfield City and put to rest Bodiccea and her followers once and for all. Return to me once you have freed the General and her troops from their pain and restored those tragic heroes to Gaia's embrace.
CompleteText=You have again returned safely! With Shadowfield City removed as a threat, we can now move supplies to and from our allies in Swineland much easier. I truly hope Bodiccea is now at peace, along with those who died with her while defending beastkind in their darkest hour here in Grunes Tal. Thank you for finally putting them to rest at last.

Travel south of Redeemer's Hall, and you will find a small encampment of Undead which serves as the "clinic" for any zombies needing repair. The Undead Chirurgeons within that medical camp carry upon them Scrolls of Everlasting Regeneration. I have seen those scrolls repair years of damage, and even attach severed limbs! Can you imagine what that would do for a few wrinkles?

Gather fifteen Everlasting Regeneration Scrolls from Undead Chirurgeons, and soon I will be able to begin my life of luxury!

BodyText=Come closer, beast-friend! I promise not to bite, really!

Truly, I mean you no harm but wish only to munch upon my favorite snack - Ale-Battered Gloom-Spites!

Ahhh  - the spicy, succulent taste of Gloom-Spites brings happiness even to my long-dead palate! Lustrous, obsidian wings provide the perfect crunchy compliment to the fat Gloom-Spite bellies when tenderly smoked over a campfire. But - I prattle on, and here I have a potential ally and fellow  "foody" who might be able to assist me?

The folk embedded in Redeemer's Hall seem to have a "kill on sight" policy with those of us living the rotted half of un-life;  and this quite puts a damper on my ability to procure my favored snack. Will you collect these tasty treasures for me? Gloom-Spites flock amidst the Spiteful Lanterneyes in the blighted fields of Shadowfield.

Collect ten of them for me, and I shall reward you with my secret recipe!
CompleteText=You got them! Thank you! Here's your reward. I have no need for money in my state, but Gloom Spites... *eats* mmmmm Delicious...

Title=Misguided Intentions
BodyText=Geoffry Thistlefur was always one of those "quiet" beasts, one who kept out of everybody else's  business well enough, never caused trouble and whatnot. But now - I think to myself - it really IS always the "quiet ones" you need to watch out for now, is it not?

I followed Geoffry on one of his far-ranging "walks" one eve, and stumbled upon his dirty little secret: He has been collecting undead and trying to re-train them as servants to beast-kind!

This will not end well if we let it continue, as the undead are conniving and bear an eternal ember of hatred for beast-kind.

Look within Shadowfield for where Geoffry has hidden these Enslaved Zombies, by traveling from the blighted town of Shadowfield and heading east toward Haunted Hill.

Exterminate the Enslaved Zombies, about six of them I believe, as well as Geoffry Thistlefur.
CompleteText=Poor Geoffry. He might have meant well, but, sometimes one must stop and consider the consequences before attempting such a foolish task as what he was trying to accomplish. I am sorry you had to kill him, though it was unavoidable as I knew he would try to protect his 'investment' as it were. Perhaps other beasts will learn from Geoffry's mistake and not attempt such a thing in the future.

Don't think I don't  know what you're up to! Yeahhhh - I'm watching you. Gots eyes in the back o' my head, I do!

Listen here, I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do, kapeesh? You see, Boss Hawg had himself a pretty sweet deal goin' on for quite some time, and things -  they was peaceful. Then, he collaborates with freakin' Vampires and lets some shady characters in where they ain't got no business. So some of us, we decided we'd show him we were a little upset at this, if you know what I mean.

To make a long story short, I took his Tee-Vee. That's right, buddy-ol-pal! That was ME! The workin' one with the "snow music disco" screen.

Things was fine for a while then, and I had my laugh. I was even gonna give it back if his lazy butt was ever gonna travel my way, ye know? But that's not good enough for Boss Hawg. He sends 'is boys down here to take his Tee-Vee back, and now there's talk of war!

Hey - me? - I was just havin' a laugh! Old fart can't take a joke anymore, I swear!

Anyways, there's a few camps 'round this Warpig Camp where Hawg's Boys are hangin' about. Now, I need you to get in there all sneaky-like or bashin-like,I gots no preference as to that matter, and takes this Tee-Vee back for me.

I ain't got the time to do this myself, no disrespect. So's if you could get a move on, that'd be great! Don't let the door hit yer behind on the way out! HA!
CompleteText=So yer back eh? Gave Hawg's boys his Tee-Vee too?

Good.

Mebbe that'll make him stop squealin' then! Much obliged. Too bad that ol' lazy butt o' his didn't come git it himself!

BodyText=There is a slouching peak northeast of here - it's true name lost to time, called now "Haunted Hill."

You think it trite? When you see the horrors that the earth vomits forth there, you will be as bereft of description as the rest of us!

Even before the rise of the undead, there was the Outcast Wars  - which ended and began at once a new era in which we cower from hordes of the pustulent undead. The Beasts here fought for their lives, or fled. A few however, tried to "ride the storm out". This, like many things here, did not end well.


At the end of the resistance, less than one hundred beasts remained who could claim nativity to the once-bountiful Grunes Tal. Among those who survived was a noble family, the Folkirks. They made their fortune in the mining business, and having earned their wealth from The Iron Maw generations ago, not a single one of them had ever worked. That, friend, is what miners, and often slaves were for.

The remaining Beasts, knowing the Folkirk Manor to be a veritable fortress, decided to fall back and wait out the undead army.

The Folkirk family however, was not amused. Not a single Beast was let inside the manor doors, and legend has it that the family members could be seen watching their comrades being ripped to shreds by zombies right outside their windows.

Most of the resistance died within a week, if they could flee, less if not. Their vengeance-hungry ghosts still haunt that hill outside the manor to this day, but there is some justice in that the Folkirk family seems to have been "turned" into undead as well.

I cannot bear the anguished cries the wind carries any longer! Please, travel to Haunted Hill north of Redeemer's Hall. Put the Vengeance-Singers out of their misery by freeing eleven of them from this realm.
CompleteText=Ah, at last, the anguished cries on the wind are no more! After you left, I heard the cries of the Singers again for a short time, yet soon all went quiet. I was certain the sudden silence was your handiwork and I was right! Finally I can have some peace around here, not that there is much peace in a land filled with undead mind you, yet I will take what I can get!

At any rate, I can only hope those poor souls are finally at peace. I wish upon no beast the horrible fate they had to endure. Thanks again for your help!

For the longest time, Grunes Tal has had neutral to uneasy relations with the Warpigs in Swineland to the northeast. Their 'habits' seemingly bizarre to most beasts, they have been left for the most part to themselves in their own land. This was before the Vampires invaded mind you, yet most in Grunes Tal never understood these creatures even back then.

The Elders of Grunes Tal, though, long knew that there would probably come a time when we beasts would probably have need of aid from the Warpigs at some point in time and made the necessary 'arrangements' that would pretty much guarantee their cooperation.

The Warpigs, you see, have this very odd fascination with relics that come from the Age of Man and will do anything to obtain them as there is nothing in this world they cherish more.

During the Outcast Wars, the Elders located one of these relics and stashed it away knowing the people of Grunes Tal would have need of it as a gift of sorts for the Warpigs at some point in the future. It is said most people scoffed at the idea, yet our Elders proceeded to pass this relic down through the generations. It was Mason Stromfeld who made the most radical decision of all and had the relic buried with him upon his death. Being a beast of note, Mason was buried within the large crypt in the Iron Hills where most of the wealthy and well known beasts of Grunes Tal were interred.

After the Undead invaded and emptied the lands of Grunes Tal of most anything living, few if any with breath still in them have been near that crypt. Yet with the Undead presence, it is quite likely that anyone resting within that place has long since been revived.

We here at Redeemer's Hall feel the time has come to retrieve the relic Mason had buried with him and fulfill the purpose for which it was originally obtained. Thus, I task you with entering the Crypt and locating Mason Stromfeld's tomb. Inside you should find the relic among his bones. If the forces of Abidan have indeed revived him, there is a chance you will have to destroy him before claiming the item. We know not what exactly this relic is, yet Mason's tomb is it's resting place. Once you have it, return to me. Now hurry up and get out of here!
CompleteText=So, you survived did you? And you have the relic? Good, let me see it!

...

So, that's what it looks like. Hmm, I must say I wasn't expecting anything of this sort really. Anyway, on to the next task!"

Well, since you came all th' way here and brought me this nice 'n fancy object, I'll sees what I can do else my name ain't Norris th' Warpig Chief Protectorate! Before I'se agree to any deals, though, I have a job fer ya. Consider it a test, if'n you will, to see if youse worth yer weight in salt! Do this here favor for me, an' I'll sees what I can do abouts helpin' out th' Redeemers.

Th' job? Well, it's simple. I wants youse to get rid o' Boss Hawg's boys fer me. Awhile back, Hawg an' his boys from th' Haz'ard Crew over in the Swineland went all crazy like and invited th' dang dambats inta the place like it was nobody's business. Since then, those dambats have been stirrin' up trouble over there an' many a warpig was forced ta leave their homes!

Now some of em, they come over here fer refuge from both th' dambats and Boss Hawg himself. Youse see, some of us warpigs, we don't care fer Hawg's business and want 'im removed. A bunch o' warpigs been tryin' for some time now to deal with him, but, haven't been that successful. Now, I'se come to learn ol' Dirty Thunder got under Hawg's skin recently over some misunderstandin' an' Hawg, he sent his boys over here ta deal with th' problem.

Now, I can't have Hawg stickin his snout in where it ain't his business! This here warpig camp is mine an' Boss Hawg aint' got no a'thority on this side o' th' river. So, if'n you an' the Redeemer's are a wantin' my help, head outside an' get rid o' Hawg's boys. Hogcatchers is what he calls em! They're like his enforcers, ya see. They've set up several camps round my town see? I wants em eliminated or sent back ta Hawg or both! Matters not how youse handle em, just get rid of em!

Title=The Missing Envoy
BodyText=Hello there. It's nice to see a friendly face among so many ruffians! Don't misunderstand, our collaboration with the warpigs both here and in Swineland has been invaluable even if a bit on rocky terms. Even still, I never expected to be hung up here!

*Sigh* I apologize friend. It would seem my temper has gotten the better of me of late. You see I have a problem. Several days ago I was sent from the Redeemer's Camp in Swineland to meet up with an envoy from our fellow Redeemers here in Grunes Tal. We were supposed to meet here at the Warpig Protectorate Camp at the borders of Swineland, but, my contact has not arrived.

I am full aware of the dangers of the Undead hordes that infest this land and would rather not stay too long; however, the person I have been sent to meet was carrying information that would greatly assist the Redeemers against both the Undead here and the Vampires in Swineland. It has been almost a week now and I have become worried that something has happened to my contact.

Since you appear to be strong, would you do me this favor and look for the envoy sent from the Hall? If you happen to find the envoy alive, please inform them that their contact is waiting at the Warpig encampment. If the worst has happened and they have fallen victim to the vile forces of Abidan, then please retrieve the documents I was sent to collect in their stead.

I shall wait here in the meantime.
CompleteText=You return. And the Envoy? ...I see. So, you found his camp and he was already dead? That is sad news indeed.

Were you able to at least locate the documents? ...Yes, these appear to be the items I was sent to retrieve. While I am indeed saddened that a fellow Redeemer has met such a terrible end, I am at least grateful that all was not lost and you were able to complete the mission in their stead. Thank you for delivering these to me along with the news of my contact's fate.

Title=The Wailing Crypt
BodyText=There are crypts south of Redeemer's Hall which were built as respectful places of remembrance by the Beast-Founders of Grunes Tal years ago. Yes, there are graveyards aplenty which surround us, but these crypts bear all-too-familiar family names. The surviving members of the families have a vested interest in making sure their relatives' remains sleep soundly, and never make it to the Village Crier's List of shocking undead murderers. You can also assume that they will pay handsomely for this task, and for your discretion.

The largest crypt within the graveyard has been reported as having caused a spot of trouble. There is a pitiful wailing coming from within, which has lured some beasts inside to investigate the source of the sound - never to return. I doubt now that the cries come from a wounded or lost child, as it may sound like at first.

At any rate, you will need to eliminate any likely witnesses, in case The Wailer hails from a family of note. Travel to the Crypts far south of Redeemer's Hall within the Iron Hills and eliminate six Crypt Diggers as well as eight Risen Corpses.

The Crypt is the home of a Revenant called the Wailer. This crypt is the largest and most evil looking in all of The Crypts. It is made of stone and lavishly decorated.
CompleteText=So, there are no more witnesses to the Wailer's incessant noise? Good. At least now whoever's family the Wailer comes from will not have their loved one's...actions exposed.

I myself ventured into that place *shivers*, and ... barely made it out alive.

The rest of my party were not so lucky. But maybe ... just maybe ... some good of their misfortune may yet come.

Deep inside the crypt where the Wailer wails, there are two strange braziers of unknown origin. The scholar in our party deduced that a sacrifice may spark their coals, releasing ancient magic to take effect and bind the Wailer to our realm.

Alas, my comrades were destroyed before we could test this theory by two of the most powerful inhabitants of the crypt. Ironically the very two sacrifices we hoped would help us finish our task. Maybe with this information, you will fare better.

Return to the graveyard, friend, and enter the Wailing Crypt itself. While I know not what unsightly horrors lie within that place, intel has claimed that the wails from this revenant seem to come from deep inside the Crypt. I have also been told the Elders of Grunes Tal at times added little puzzles for would-be looters to try and solve if they dared to disturb their resting places.

Be wary when in the Crypt, though. More than a few would-be adventurers, and even a few groups we here at the Hall have assembled, have entered that place, yet none have returned. Perhaps there is more to these 'puzzles' than most know. While searching for The Wailer's 'resting' place, be on the lookout for clues on how to get past the Elders' Crypt puzzles. Surely some of these will help solve the mystery of the Wailer's existence.

Return to me once you have taken care of The Wailer and have put it's obviously restless soul to a final peace.
CompleteText=You return safely friend! The Wailer has been put to rest? Excellent. Remember friend, keep The Wailer's identity to yourself for the sake of the family it belonged to. It is scandal enough that the creature was even causing problems. By eliminating that revenant as an issue, the families whose loved ones rest in that crypt can be rest assured their good names will not be tainted by this incident. Please accept one of these as thanks from both myself and the families whose reputations you have preserved. They, themselves, might not wish to say it, but I do. Take care and good fortune in your travels!

BodyText=Greetings good beast, it's nice to see another reach the Redeemer's Hall.  These days that's a rare sight.  Especially due to the increasing threat of the feral creatures of Grunes Tal. They seem to be breeding rather quick and now are starting to wander into our camp, threatening lives.  You seem like you can handle yourself, though. Would you take care of them?
CompleteText=Fantastic! You've done it, but there are more beasts of the wild that need handling if you're up for it.

As it now seems I must return to the Redeemer's Camp to inform my fellow Redeemers of my contact's death, would you deliver the documents you were able to retrieve to Damian Talamasca in Front Line Camp in my place? Damian is the commanding officer of our forces stationed at the Front Line and I am certain the information contained in these notes will be of great assistance there. I assure you they can use all the help they can get.

Thank you so much!

You see, the local Night-Mares provide us Redeemers with a valuable resource: Vile Bihyl. This thick ichor, extracted from Night-Mare spleens, protects us against vampires by turning our blood repugnant to vampires. The taste is foul beyond measure, but a necessary evil if you wish to survive here at the Front Line.

Take to the wilds and harvest eight pints of Vile Bihyl from Night-Mares, and kill twelve of their handlers, the Valkal Steedmasters. It may save your own life one day!

BodyText=South of this Front-Line encampment, the Ice Goliaths are constantly trampling a more precious resource than most of us could ever imagine - Gaia's Tears. We believe that the crystals form as a result of millions of seasons' pressure from the mountains and a constant cold temperature, creating a snow-crystal of distilled aquae so pure that it is practically blessed by Gaia herself!

This purity, of course, makes the resultant liquid a very effective vampire killer. Well, kind of. You see, this only works on those vampires who are weakened, or resting. But we Redeemers will take any chance we can get!

Travel south until you see the Ice Goliaths - they are easily angered, step wise! Collect six Gaia's Tears from around where the Ice Goliaths have dug their "nests".

Title=Blood Thicker Than Water
BodyText=Justi Ambereye, once one of the most adored of The Redeemers, now roams the wastelands here in Swineland - forever tainted beyond any semblance of what we consider life.

The Ursine's gentle paws had saved countless lives, ruled fairly in the council, and even taught my son to fish after the death of his father. Now, he bears the same face, and with twisted savagery has torn apart several of his family and friends.

You see, the Vampires knew what a strategist Justi was, and he brought The Redeemers so very close to defeating the entire brood before they took him. Vampires have not been known to "turn" beasts, I do not even believe they can! Yet one of their mages had successfully ensorcelled poor Justi into believing he was of Vampire-Kind! And he believes it today - living in the wastes as a heartless, killing machine.

I cannot stand for this to continue! The beast that once was, no longer exists. He serves no real threat to The Redeemers, but seeing one of our "family" so defiled is an affront to all that exists!

Travel to Old Scraptown, as Justi was seen there last. Bring him peace, friend, and return to me with the Ambereye Signet Ring.
CompleteText=Justi.... He was the best of us and they got him.  Everything he worked so hard to do was undone... His death won't be in vain! Thank you for bringing him peace.

We've tried several times to send a task force in to eliminate Lord Valkal and his kin, but something is preventing us from gaining entry into the stronghold.  It's almost a barrier of sorts... Some form of evil magic shields the place from the inside.

We've been searching as best we can for a way to break the seal but to no avail.  If you truly want to help us, search the grounds of the Keep for any clues as to how to gain entrance into the stronghold itself. While you are at it, and if possible, take out a few of those cold bodies while you are at it!

Title=The Mark of Death
BodyText=Wait, I think I've solved it!! The Mark of Death doesn't literally mean Death itself, it refers to an object! "The Key is buried with the dead" means the artifact is literally buried somewhere. "Only the Mark of Death will let you in" This is basically the answer itself. The Mark of Death itself is the Key!

Where would it be hidden though? It wouldn't be too close to the Blood Keep as people would expect that, but it also couldn't be miles away... wait the Mausoleum!

Just west of here is the Old Wartown Cemetery. The place used to be where the city's citizens buried their dead, but, it hasn't been used in generations. Vampires have been sighted in the general area but none have been confirmed to have actually entered the structure itself. Head to the abandoned Mausoleum and see if you can find this Mark of Death that this riddle speaks of. Be careful, though, I can only imagine what must be dwelling in there.
CompleteText=You have it!! Incredible! Odd though... Such an object as this one would think would emit some sort of power, yet I feel nothing from it. There must be more to this riddle. Thank you for all your help.

I was doing my midnight patrol the other day when I spotted a sizable Vampire pack headed in the direction of Wartown. Assuming it was a raid I quickly followed them, but suddenly they seemed to vanish out of sight. My only thought is they are hiding out in the old Mausoleum until they are ready to attack.

To make things worse a Giant Vampider recently took refuge outside the Mausoleum door.  I doubt its a coincidence!  Kill the Vampider and 20 of Valkal's kin as well! Show them they aren't as clever as they think.

Title=The Nook-le-are Path
BodyText=Nook has spoken of an outsider who would walk th' Nook-le-are Path and prepare us fer th' Great Splitting. It has happened once before when Man became consumed with hatred to hisself and lost sight o' the Nook's salvation. The Great Nook split then and th' world was reborn... though Man was no more.

The second splitting is coming and we need ta be ready. Now here's where you come in.... South o' Wartown there's a very sacred and Holy place filled with th' ticking god's essence. Many a warpig is encouraged ta' go on th' pilgrimage to th' Nook-le-are Path an' bask in th' essence o' Nook.

(Norris sighs in reflection.)

I 'member long ago when my brother Boris an' I went on our pilgrimage. Both o' us were excited ta finally fulfill a dream. When we returned from th' Nook-le-are Path, having basked in th' glory that is th' essence o' the Great Nook, it filled us with gladness. Well, least it filled me with gladness anyhow. Unknown ta me, Boris wasn't satisfied an' wanted more. Sometime later, yers truly was chosen by The Great One as his next Great Speaker.

While th' rest o' Nook's followers rejoiced, Boris was furious. In a fit o' jealousy he insisted Nook shoulda chosen him instead an' that everthin' was a big fat lie. Soon after that, Boris lost his faith. I watched in sadness as me own flesh an' blood turned his back on everone here in Nook Town and left.

Unfortunately, th' story don't end there. Some years passed 'til a few months ago when I received word from a few pilgrims that Boris had formed his own sect o' worshippers o' th' Nook. More recently, they'se been preachin' a terrible heresy. Boris' followers 'ave been a'spreadin' th' claim that th' Nook-le-are Path is the 'one true way' to salvation an' the 'true believers' must constantly bask in Nook's divine essence ta remain pure. Even worse, I'se been gettin' reports recently o' warpigs bein' attacked while attemptin' to go on their pilgrimages.

What utter heresy an' blasphemy!

While youse go on yer own pilgrimage to the Nook-le-are Path for th' ticking god, find those blasphemin' heretics occupyin' Nook's holy path and eliminate 'em. Ye'll be makin' it safe fer all the gen-u-wine true believers ta once again be able ta make their own pilgrimages to th' Path.
CompleteText=I see we have a new believer in our midst! I can feel Nook's essence radiatin' right offa ya.. ...and ya dealt with th' heretics too? Ya did...? I'se sure Nook is greatly pleased.   ... what's this...?

Please fergive my outburst there. Mine heart is grieved at th' news ya brought. As a fellow believer in th' great ticking god, I must make a'nother request o' ya. As th' Great Speaker o' the Nook, I pass sentence upon my brother. Boris has lost his way an' has chosen ta willin'ly commit th' unpardonable. His blasphemies are an affront ta both th' Great Nook an' all Nook-believin' warpigs! As a new believer in 'th Nook, I charge ya with th' task o' dealin' with 'im. Return to the Nook-le-are Path and seek out Boris' hidin' place. When ya find his foul and blasphemin' heretic carcass, I want ya to show 'im no mercy. Eliminate him an' liberate th' holy path from his ilk for all true Nook-believers! Go!
CompleteText=You has returned I see. So, Boris is feedin' th' vultures and th' Nook-le-are Path is once again open ta all?

I can't thank ya enuf. Ye've only been here a short time, yet, ya done so much in th' Nook's service. While I'se goin' ta miss Boris in spite o' his betrayal, I wants ta give ya somethin' fer yer trouble. Take one o' these with ya when ya go on yer way. Taint much, but, consider it as reward fer th' faithful.

Title=Piece of the Puzzle
BodyText=So, these last few weeks I've been examining the Mark of Death artifact trying to understand what was wrong with it and why it won't work. After many almost-sleepless nights of scrutinizing this thing, it finally hit me! The key itself isn't complete. Look, right there! As you can see, there is a piece missing, a stone by the looks of the rather subtle impression. With us closing in on his Blood Keep I'm willing to bet Valkal decided to pull one over on us and split the key to his Keep in two. He left the largest part of it in that Mausoleum with his shadow as a lure to keep us distracted. However, in the event that piece was somehow taken by us, he likely had the other piece hidden somewhere else.

While some of us set for you, a few others went investigating where that other piece to the Mark of Death might be. They came back only yesterday with information that makes your return all the more timely. A partially torn note was found on one of those bloodsuckers near the base of the Keep that revealed the other piece of the Mark of Death has likely been taken out of Swineland itself. Well, not yet at least. It seems Valkal had been keeping the other piece with one of his 'sons' until you defeated his shadow.

Realizing a powerful opponent has appeared on our side, Valkal now seems to be trying to get that piece out of Swineland and to a more secure location...which can only mean he's sent it to be taken through the Dambat Door.

The Dambat Door, or so the warpigs call it, is the gate that leads out of Swineland and into the Lurkers Vale beyond. The Vale is a terrible place in recent years as the Blood Clans have gained near complete control over the region. We have reason to believe this is where the stone is being taken by some discreet courier. Hurry to the Dambat Door and intercept that courier carrying the other piece to the Mark of Death before it is too late!!
CompleteText=The Dambat Door is probably the most dangerous place in Swineland outside of the Blood Keep itself! I can't believe you were able to fight them off and retrieve the stone. INCREDIBLE!

BodyText=Whatever this thing is, it now seems to be functioning! You can feel the raw energy emitting from it to the point I'm anxious to be rid of it. Okay, if what we have suspected is true, then by using the Mark of Death we can finally gain entrance into Valkal's Blood Keep. If it works as expected, then we can finally cut the head off the snake, so to speak, and liberate Swineland. This task is far above me, though, so you'll have to report the Captain of the Camp. He's over by the large tent. Good luck friend!
CompleteText=Greetings warrior! I have been carefully following your progress with the war effort since you first came to our little camp offering assistance. Know that you may have single handedly given us an opportunity to finally put an end to this war that was otherwise a losing battle. Now, let's discuss the assualt plans.

BodyText=Now that we hold the key to Valkal's fortress of death on top the hill that overlooks the Dambat Pass, your objective is clear. However don't be fooled as this undertaking will be unlike ANYTHING you have ever experienced up until now. Valkal has personally been responsible for the death of thousands and can not be taken lightly.

Even once inside the Keep, Valkal is protected in his fortress by the ancient fell magics of his kind. He cannot be confronted outright by any means. The only way to reach him is to find some way to break the seal that guards him. Only then can he be defeated. Further, because the Vampires within Lord Valkal's fortress are quite likely very powerful, barring Valkal himself, it would be wise to take strong friends with you in this endeavor. I cannot stress this enough.

Speak to a few of the other Redeemers before you head to the Blood Keep. They also have tasks for you. Now, go warrior! Go and put an end to the dark shadow that Valkal has cast over Swinelnad once and for all!
CompleteText=So, it is finished. It is finally over! It's funny, you know. Somehow we knew the exact moment that Valkal's life ended. There was an encumberance lifted off our shoulders. Not a soul in Swineland, nay, in all of Europe, that can express the debt we owe you for what you've done. You have saved so many lives by your deeds. Thank you mighty beast! Take this small token of our gratitude, you have more then deserved it.

Now, I hate to ask this of you, especially after everything you have done for the Redeemers; but even if you manage to kill Valkal himself, one of his Vaj 'sons' will likely take his place as Lord of the Keep. To prevent that from happening, you will need to completely end Valkal's House. Somewhere within the Keep you will find two of Valkal's most powerful 'sons'. Their names are Samir and Venae. One of these two Vaj are the most likely to take over should Valkal himself die. Eliminate them before that can happen!
CompleteText=You succeeded?! Friend, know that to kill one Vampire Lord is considered an amazing feat. To kill more than that is an unspeakable feat beyond comprehension. I don't know how we can properly repay you for your deeds. This isn't much considering all you have done, but, regardless, please accept this as a reward and know that none here will forget you.

Title=The Legend of Grindle
BodyText=Vargan's Book of Lore is a large and aged tome. You search the pages and find several entries about the story of Grindle. It is said Grindle was once a young and handsome beast, beloved by all and feared by none. Then came the horrors of the Bleakness. In the darkest depths of that time, Grindle's love Heraldine was taken by the Vampires. Grindle was grief stricken and set out to rescue her. He was no knight, but he claimed he would save her or die trying. He was never seen again. While unclear how, the legend tells that he made a deal with Abidan to save his love from the Vampires. Abidan transformed him into a hideous Revenant - this gave him the power he needed to attempt his rescue. The legend goes on to say that he fought fiercely in his transformed body and did, in fact, save Heraldine. There was, however, no happy ending. Heraldine had no idea how she was rescued or what happened to her love Grindle. She assumed he was lost trying to rescue her. Then came the Winter Dawning Festival. Heraldine sat on the cliffs overlooking the sea. A sound startled her and a hideous creature approached. She screamed, but the beast spoke to her. To her disbelief it claimed to be her lost love Grindle, but she could not reckon it. She went mad. Heraldine, so distraught at the hideous appearance of her lover, threw herself off a cliff. It is here that the tale of Grindle is born. Mothers use the specter of Grindle to scare their children. Grindle is always watching! If children misbehave then Grindle will come, at Winter Dawning, and steal their presents from under the festival tree! Most dismiss any truth to these legends and claim they are just scary stories, but, over the years supposed sightings of Grindle have been made at various locations. Three locations seem to stand out. In Anglorum, more sightings than any other location are in and around the Abandoned Monastery. In New Badari, there are tales of something strange living in the Dunklehimer Brewery cellar that resembles Grindle. Finally, in the Heartwood, many Grindle sightings were noted around the Dark Depths.  Some say he's in all three spots. That he uses his dark magic to infiltrate Europe and Anglorum, steal the presents and joy and bring them back to his lair in Winterland.
