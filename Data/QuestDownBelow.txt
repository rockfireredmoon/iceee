Title=The Doctor
BodyText=Hail friend. My name is Arianna Glennell. my husband and I- when we lived - ruled here...before it fell. All things that remain here now are monstrous or unliving.

It has been far too long since anyone new has walked these halls. It is good to cast my eyes upon the living once more.

Once we ruled a vast area beyond. Then in the deepest depths of the Bleakness we sealed our doors in an attempt to protect our very lives from the wave of death sweeping across the continent. My husband made this decision against my wishes! I..I had to abide by his decision. I DID convince him to bring as many peasants into the castle before sealing the doors. At least I did the best I could to save the less fortunate. Though in the end perhaps they would have had a better chance on the outside.

We had sealed ourselves inside this place but we were not alone. Soon, after we sealed the castle and collapsed the mountain on the entrance, people began to vanish in the night. The castle is massive even now, though much of it has collapsed, but then it was an entire city built deep into the rock. It was not long before I discovered the source of the evil - my own husband. He had been affected by some evil and in the end we killed him but not before he cursed us all to this eternal undeath - this limbo.

In the end there were five of us who finally destroyed the beast my husband had become. The first was the doctor Ran Dangran; he was always a friend to our family. Then there was Seranno, the Master Chef and the Guard Captain, Elian Grudge. Finally there was a priest of Gaia - he who in the end slew my husband with his own hands - Ferran Hollowind. It took all of us to destroy the beast. Now I only hope you can help us find peace.

You must kill all those who slew the Duke. The Doctor, the Chef and the Captain are where to begin, they must be set to rest. Their souls must be captured and brought here and placed in these reliquaries. There is a sealed door in the far east of the castle on the lower level. Once these three are free this door will open and you may help Ferran finally be at rest. Finally you must slay me - and I will not resist. The others however - they are so lost they may object, but you must free them nonetheless.

You should begin with Ran Dangran. You can find him in his old laboratory. Take this vessel. When you slay Ran his soul will be captured inside the vessel. Go now and good luck!
CompleteText=Very well done. The first step is complete. You can now use the first teleporter for easier access to the rest of the castle. The teleporters are located directly below this platform. Each teleporter has a blue crystal and blue particle atop them.

Your ears were so eager to hear my lies and believe them! My husband was a fool - just like you! Now I can finally rejoin Ferran and he will be reborn and rule this world! I warn you - do not venture into the lowest levels. Beyond that door is only death for you! Now I must go - and be...myself again... Thank you friend! Ahahahah!

If I had not seen it with my own eyes I would not have...""...she was my wife...but now she lies with the beast...""...this may be my last entry, We have sealed the dungeon door. Ran, Elian and Seranno aided me and I could not have done it with out their help, hopefully my sacrifice will be enough to keep him there...though his curse may doom those who still live..."The journal tells the true story of what happened here. The Duchess and Ferran seem to have been responsible for the terror.Arianna lied to you and is obviously evil to the core - hunt her down and slay her for what she has done.

This place was once regarded as only legend but now we see it revealed. There are many mysteries inside I am sure. You should talk to the rest of my team here. I am sure some could use your help.

BodyText=Greetings! If you are planning to explore the Down Below then perhaps you could do me a favor. There is a rare type of mushroom - Blue Crown Mushrooms they are called - that grow in abundance inside. I could really use a dozen of these mushrooms to study. If you could collect them for me I would greatly appreciate it! Also, if you have not already, you should speak with Trent. He is studying the effects of the Blue Crown Mushrooms on some denizens of the Down Below.

I am interested in how these mushrooms may effect creatures who are constantly in contact with them. I would like some samples from some of the larger creatures to study.
