Title=Gathering Corruption
BodyText=The grove here has gone very wrong. While it is grand that all the beasts are returning from the groves of Mother Gaia, it would seem all the evil of the world still lurks and is slowly returning to the world as well. I have been investigating the corruption of this grove. I am convinced this was done intentionally. I saw some strange totems in the grove - they are not natural. They seem to attract the Unikorns. Wherever the Unikorns go, corruption follows. You could help greatly by collecting some of the twisted growths that have sprouted up in and around the grove itself, and some Unikorn Horns. I believe I can cleanse the totems with these items. Yes, sometimes you have to fight corruption with tiny bits of corruption, itself.

Title=Tinheart's Lament: Blood Petal Flower
BodyText=*Sigh* While you were gathering the blossoms, I saw my love - oh Penelope! - and I told her I would shortly have her six Krell Blossoms. She then told me... ...she did not want Krell Blossoms! She wanted a single Blood Petal Flower... A Blood Petal Flower! Do you know where they grow? No? I do. Trust me, I do not want to go there. Far in the south of Midlands, near the bordering cliffs of Grunes Tal, is a thick dark wood, a Haunted Grove. It has been overtaken by the Undead. Not just 'undead' - not some shoddy skeleton come back to haunt the local grave yard - but THE Undead! Actual minions from the depths of Sheol! I must have this flower, for without it I will never have my love - oh Penelope! Please, I implore you, if you would get me that flower, you would make me the happiest being alive!
CompleteText=You got it? Do not jest with me! Let me see! Oh friend, you truly are that - a friend! Now she will have to pay me heed! Thank you so much! Please, take this reward.

Title=Goliath Mounds
BodyText=Yes? Hello there. Are you interested in Goliaths? I am. I study them quite diligently. You know much of them? I do.

The Goliaths are the remains of the Maar, long passed great beings made of stone. Ages ago, the Maar were the greatest crafters in all the world. They crafted weapons for the Titans and, without their aid, Atan may have never defeated Vinga and ended the Bleakness. When the Cataclysm came and Age of Man ended, the Maar were split on their beliefs. Prometheus believed they should cleanse the world. It would take time, but it was within their power. On the other side, Epimethius thought they should just stay in the home deep in the Under Realm. You see, the Maar had a device called the Orean Symmetry. All beings within its effective working radius would have their lives extended to incredible lengths. There was a catch, though. If you left the radius, all that "extended time" would come crashing down on you. You would age all those years impossibly fast and thus die. Prometheus, aided by the gods, created the Temporal Aegis. This allowed the Maar to leave their home and begin to cleanse the world. In an act of betrayal, Epimethius betrayed those who left. He was tricked with a promise of power by agents of Djall, the Krostakin. Epimethius destroyed the Temporal Aegis, thus killing those outside the radius of the Orean Symmetry. In the aftermath, Epimethius was granted the power he sought, but not in the way he planned. Djall does indeed keep his promises, though. He was transformed into the first of the Goliaths. But now gone was reason, and the skill which defined the Maar. Left behind was the hulking giants. Nothing more than semi-mindless hulks. Ages later, we see them still, the Goliaths of today.

Ah well, that was a bit of history! Now I am concerned about the Goliaths. They are normally brutish, but generally harmless as long as you stay out of their way. Lately though, they have become aggressive. Some have even ranged from the areas surrounding their mounds, causing problems along the roads in Midlands. I want you to go and investigate the northern and southern Goliath mounds to the east, then report back to me with what you find there.
CompleteText=You return. They are building odd stacks of rocks and trees? Hmmm.... I have noticed other strangeness too, recently. They still maintain some of their ancestral building instinct, as you saw at their mounds. Like you, I have noticed their new creations are less sophisticated, almost as if they are losing what little intelligence they have left. Something is certainly going on. I will have to do more research.

Hate the nasty beasts. They might be big, ferocious and loud, but I tell you, yes indeed, they can sneak right up on you and pounce! Hate bears - absolutely!

You have arrived just in time. I could use some help. Two of our adventurers have gone missing. They had planned on a trip to the old coastal cave below the ruins in the north. In recent months, the entire place has been taken over by fiery-wolf beasts. Rough bunch they are, nearly as bad as the bears. There was talk of one of these wolves being humongous. Gyta and Jod, my missing adventurers, wanted to hunt the beast and return with the creature's head as a trophy. That was days ago. We have not seen nor heard from them since they left. I would ask you, would you go to the Coastal Cave and see if you can find my adventurers? I would go myself but I... Uhmm... My leg you see... ...is just not up for adventuring. Yes, my leg!
CompleteText=Oh thank Gaia you have come. That creature... ...it was horrible. It killed Jod - I think it devoured him whole! I ran for my life, but I was mauled by two more of the smaller beasts... I am fine, now. I have been trying to recover my strength to return to Listerm. I want revenge for my friend, though! Would you be my weapon? Would you kill the beast for me?

The pilgrimage is simply to light all three. One lays just beyond the city limits of Listerm. The other two are also just outside of the town propers of Baffle Gate and Bandit's Bluff.

If you wish to ensure Gaia's blessing, then simply light the three braziers. Once you have done, speak with Ceryn Yewl in Bandit's Bluff. Gaia's blessings go with you.

BodyText=While you were gone, I was informed of another Goliath issue. His name is Donk... Well, that is what the locals call him. Normally quite passive, he would often wander near the outskirts of the town. I was told just now that he is on some kind of a rampage on the southern road heading towards Grunes Tal, attacking anyone that wanders by. I am sad to say we should do away with him. While I wish the creature no ill will, we cannot have a giant Goliath attacking people on the road. Find Donk and put an end to him.
CompleteText=Ah, poor Donk. We did the right thing, though. Thank you for help and please accept this reward.

Title=Crushing the Hand
BodyText=Hail. I am in dire need of assistance friend. Do you have time to hear my plea?
My sons are now dead. Killed by the deceitful cult of Zaraster! My sons were young and naive. They became involved in the Hand of Zaraster. At first I thought it was just yet another way for them to rebel against me but soon I began to fear for their very souls. Razlen Zaraster is a monster. He entraps young innocent minds in his web of lies - he has some kind of mind control! Alas he led both my boys to their deaths and for this I want the entire Hand of Zaraster destroyed.
They occupy several camps across Anglorum. I ask that you kill the three organizers: Oglan Ironhead, Granger Lashley and Blanche Marin. Once you have returned their vile souls to Gaia I ask that you confront and kill Razlen Zaraster himself. I do warn you though - Razlen is a powerful mage. If you truly seek to end his life you must bring friends to aid you.
I can offer little in return other than some weapons I have collected over the years and my eternal gratitude.
Could you do this for me?
CompleteText=You have returned successful?
Wonderful. Though this will do little to lessen the sadness in my heart for my lost boys - at least it may prevent another father from this same grief.
Thank you and farewell.

BodyText=The notes you brought from Gunnar confirms some of my own research. I am convinced someone is manipulating the Goliaths. If I had to guess, I would say that someone would most likely be found in the Goliath ruins to the east. The ruins are the remains of an old temple buried deep in a mountain. The Goliaths seems to have excavated it. There is a cavern entrance atop the mount. If you are up for a trek, I could use your help. I want you to go into the Goliath ruins and look for anyone there that does not belong. In short, if you find anything other than Goliaths or general other creatures, that is the one behind all of this. I am not going to say I want you to kill someone you find there, but if this continues, the entire region is in terrible danger. We must put an end to this.
CompleteText=You found what? You found a Lich! That is terrible news. It can only mean the Undead are planning something sinister. They have already breached the southern border from Grunes Tal. This is very bad.

I am seeking what the locals call Sparkling Greens. I am told Goliaths gnaw on them, creating a fascinating finish.

Title=The Haunted Grove
BodyText=We were exploring the Blighted Wood. It has become infested with Undead recently. My friends and fellow Adventurer's Guild members, Stefan, Snype and Ombwah, thought perhaps we could find the source and do something to end, or at least slow down, the progression of the Undead. We were half right. Far to the south, there is a grove, though it is nothing I could liken to anything created by Gaia. It is dark and dead. The Undead are thick there. We breached the grove and sought to find what could be at the heart of it. We never found out. The creatures there were beyond our power. We escaped the grove and were clear of the Undead. We made camp a distance away. In the night they came. They took my friends, screaming, back into the grove. I fear they are all dead, or worse. The legions of Sheol do not grow by birth, but by transformation - the living turned into the unliving. Left soulless and mindless forever.

I beg of you, search for my friends. If you can rescue them, then please do. If they have been transformed into Undead, then do them the favor of putting them out of their misery and return them to Gaia's warm embrace.
CompleteText=Do they live? Oh... I see. Then I must at least thank you for ending their suffering.

BodyText=Hello, hello! Thaddeus Toadhollow is the name, goods and services is my game! Though, at the moment I am in need of services to collect some of my own goods! You see, those blasted Stonelions attacked the last caravan of goods coming to the camp. They took everything. I had some fine goods I was expecting, but now they are gone - stolen! I will pay very well if you can retrieve even three crates of my stolen goods. I am sure they took all the crates back to their make-shift fortress they have built in the north.

Title=Ritual of the Mist
BodyText=Greetings. Eastbridge could use your aid traveller. To the east is an old ruin. It is filled with mist and within the mist lurk deadly spiders. Long ago a local druid built three altars in the ruins. When the spiders begin to spill out of the mist and encroach on the town we must go and cleanse the altars in the blood of a giant spider. That time has come again. Would you aid us?
That task is simple but dangerous. There is a giant spider in the ruins known as Lurrk. You must first kill him. Once he is dead you must take some of his blood to each of the three altars. Once this is done the ritual should keep the spiders at bay for at least another season. Be wary though! Lurrk is very powerful and deadly - bring friends with you if you truly wish to succeed!
CompleteText=You are a true friend to Eastbridge! Please take one of these rewards and our heartfelt thanks.

BodyText=My family has maintained this lighthouse for generations. Normally, its quite a mundane, but fulfilling life. That has all changed. Did you see those crazy plants on your way up here? Plants? Walking around like beasts! What has this world come to? To make matters worse, now the Undead have been creeping out of the sea! I am baffled by the entire situation.  One thing is clear, though, I need these menaces gone. If you want to help, at least you can thin the numbers of the Undead. The plants worry me far less. Go and kill twenty-five of those walking piles of bones. Maybe that will spook the rest of them away and I can return to a life of peace and quiet!

You see, initially they were hired by some fellow in Rolsburg to put an end to the Trolls. The buggers got 'lost' and discovered my brewery. They soon forgot all about the Trolls! They tossed everyone out of the Brewery and have been drinking their fill ever since. The 10th Legion did not want to step in a full out attack since that would put Bremen at risk of a small war. We all hoped they would simply drink their fill and go home, but no luck. They have been here for almost a year now! My last resort is simply to get all the Ale recipes from the brewery and start over someplace else. I need someone to get inside the brewery cellar and collect the recipes! Would you do this for me?

He and I have a well balanced working relationship and he is currently assisting me with yet another delicate matter - a matter that you could help with, as well.  In the far end of the city is a small tavern called the Dead End. Go there and speak with Alter Volt, he is the barkeep. Give him this letter and tell him I sent you to speak with Lucius. That should be enough for Alter to allow you to meet with him, but then he can be a stubborn fellow.

I wish you luck and look forward to our next meeting.

BodyText=Well, I suppose I am getting ahead of myself. My apologies. Allow me to introduce myself, I am Lucius Nightswift. Do not look too surprised, friend. Yes, I am still alive, though it does me good for most to think I am a myth. Perhaps one day I will share my story with you, but for now I welcome you among the ranks of the Grey Circle. Again, you look surprised. I am sure you are wondering why the Lady of Bremen would send you to meet with 'thieves'? Hah! I assure you, we do quite a bit more than thieving. Always have, but it does serve my own purposes for most to consider the Circle nothing more than thieves.

Now to the matter at hand. The Lady sent you to me for a single purpose - VonGruber. She cannot openly oppose him in more than the political arena. She has tried every avenue to appease him, or get him to back down on his separatist ideals. Nothing has worked and he is now threatening civil war. You have seen firsthand the Legion of Sheol's dirty work here and in Midlands. The last thing this land can stand now is a civil war. Thus, it falls to us to end the problem at the tip of a blade.

It is bloody task, no doubt. I assure you, if the Lady was convinced there was any other solution she would pursue it with all her might, but there is not. VonGruber has openly called for war and is building an army. The Lady will not allow this to stand. The quickest way to end the entire affair is in the dark of night with a blade to the throat. This is where you come in.

Yes, I am asking you to assassinate Baron VonGruber. The only question is, do you have the heart for it?

The double doors across the room lead to a passage that exits directly behind the VonGruber estate. You may use it to travel there unseen and return.
CompleteText=Friend, you are safely returned. For this I am glad. You have done a great service to all the people of New Badari this day. Even though there will surely be political fallout for the Lady, she will be greatly pleased.

I can understand why the Lady chose you for her dirty business and Lucius seems quite keen on your ability as well. I have seen heroes come and go over the ages. More are forgotten than remembered and even more die seeking to become a thing of legend. Perhaps you can entertain me by performing a small task. Nothing a true hero cannot handle, if you are such a being. I simply want the fangs of Dar Kulgac. She is a rather vicious creature, cunning and wise, but still nothing truly more than a monster, really. You can find her lair far to the south, through the Trolls camps. She keeps the trolls as pets, I think. So hero, are you ready to prove yourself?
CompleteText=We meet again... ...and I see you killed the Manticore. Did I forget to mention she was a Manticore? Perhaps I did. Matters not, as you have proven yourself to be quite a hero, after all. I have lived for some time and collected some wondrous items. Take this key and open the chest to my right. Take one item that pleases you. Perhaps I will have need of you again, hero, or perhaps you will have need of me. Farewell.

Title=Sleeping Giant: Preparations
BodyText=To the east sleeps Thingir Mossheart, a giant even amongst the Treekin. He still slumbers amidst the rot that surrounds him. He was the last of the Treekin to fade into slumber and thus is still slumbering. The Rotted seek to corrupt his heart before he awakens. If this were to come to pass, it would be a devastating blow to our cause. Mossheart is more than just a Treekin, he is both a symbol and a mighty warrior. If he were to fall to the darkness of the rot, this war would turn very decidedly against us.

We do what we can to bolster his protection while he slumbers. This is where I can use your help. There is a rune stone at the base of where he sleeps. On a regular basis we activate its power to help drive back the rot and allow Mossheart to slumber in peace. There are preparations that must be made before doing so. First, I would ask you to travel to the ruins north of the city. The place is infested with giant walking eyes. While they are vile, they do serve a purpose. Their pupils contain a fluid that is used as part of the rune stone activation. We allow them to flourish in the ruins just for this purpose. Travel the ruins and collect ten pupils from the creatures, and then return to me.

BodyText=Greetings. Welcome to the Heartwood Temple. This temple is the heart of the Order of Gaia. While we seek peace, these days we are truly at war. The Rotted and the Amanita Virosa are tireless in their efforts to spread their rot into the Great Forest. While the front line is truly in the Green Line Thicket, we here still do what we can to deal with the outbreaks of rot within the forest.

I could do with some help in this regard. Of late, patches of the forest to the east have begun to fester with decay. Our only hope of reclaiming these areas is to constantly destroy the Rotted and Amanita Virosa influence in the area. If you could travel east and destroy some of these fiends, it would be of great help to us all.

If you destroy them while they are still dormant, then they will be rendered harmless. Oddly enough, inside of these pustules you will find a seed that actually has some medicinal value. Please, if you could, travel east and destroy ten of the pustules before they mature and further rot the area. Collect the seed from inside each one you destroy.
CompleteText=Not only have you help to fight the spread of the rot, these seeds will be helpful to those who are ill. Thank you very much for your assistance.

I was on the road, traveling from Eastbridge to Bremen. As I approached the Henge I was beset by brigands! They attacked my wagon and killed my servant. I ran for my life - I barely escaped with my life! As I said I can do without most of the stolen items but the jewelry box has precious heirlooms I most dearly desire be returned to me. Please travel to the site of the attack and see if you can retrieve the jewelry box.

BodyText=The time has come. The items you have gathered for me are used to burn as an offering to Gaia. Now that I have performed the offering, I can pass on to you the ability to activate the rune stone. But beyond that, I ask of you to also slay Sinoak. Sinoak is leading the charge to corrupt Mossheart. Destroying him will also help to protect Mossheart while he sleeps. Go now and good luck!
CompleteText=You return successful. I am glad both for your success and your safety. You have done a great service to all those who call the Great Forest home. Please take this key. You may use it to open the Oakbound Chest here. You may take one item of your choosing.

Thank you again and may Gaia walk with you, always.

The only problem I am having is that in order to be a merchant of any worth, you must be a member of the Merchant's Guild, headquartered in Bazarrt. Not just anyone can join either, you have to be recommended, and that is particularly cumbersome.

I have one small glimmer of hope, however! If you could travel to Cracked Rock to the south and make your way along the road to Nantes Waystation, there is a beast there named Lazlo Gont. He is the Merchant's Guild representative there, and I would like you to bring him this letter to formally request my membership into the guild.

Bring my request to Lazlo in Nantes Waystation and, I beg of you, do anything you can to earn my favor with him. My future livelihood depends on it!

However, there is a new twisted growth which has emerged around these rings, Festering Sarsaparilla. In the healthy regions of the forest, sarsaparilla grows normally and brews into a fine and refreshing drink.

Now however, I have discovered that I can make a very strong ale out of the plant, which the young, or more adventurous beasts, have really taken a liking to.

No harm in making a bit of profit out of our forest's disease, eh?

I may not look it, but I hail from a long and prestigious line of winemakers. Yes, that was long ago, and my once beautiful family vineyard has since been irreversibly corrupted ever since the Shard of the Spirit Mother hit the Dire Murk. Yes, even before I was born!

Yet, I still hold the family tradition of protecting beasts from the ravages of the twisted vineyard. I am old however, and was not blessed with any children to pass these tasks to. Will you help me?

I need some beast to travel southeast of Far Reach and light the fires within the corrupted vineyard.

It seems trifling, but I assure you it is not. The fires are magical and keep the vines from re-animating and spreading through the forest. They must be re-lit every now and again however, and that is my request to you.

Once a thriving village, it was destroyed when a splinter fell from the heavens - a shard of the Spirit Mother. The effect on the town was terrible.

This, in particular, is where I need your assistance. The Shadow Legion is a great threat. Even a small break that allows them to enter our world is dangerous. I ask of you to go to the ruins of Tall Stand and destroy at least twenty-five Shadows. Every effort to keep them contained is indeed a good effort.

You see, there I was minding my own business, hunting Thunderwalkers for sport, when out of nowhere comes this big nasty Thunderwalker named Horridus. He just about trampled me, he did, but I ran away in time. I do not take kindly to giant creatures trying to trample me while I am just out for a friendly hunt! I want you kill Horridus.

This creates added expenses to any merchant traveling south of here, as they need to employ ever larger security details in order to make it through safely.

Those that do not have a large enough mercenary staff end up paying in loss of goods, or in bribes. This has caused the price of even the most basic goods to climb to a ridiculous level!

All of this is bad for everyone. I have been trying to better understand their culture. There are some strange totems in their camps. I have never been able to get close enough to truly examine them. If you could make some detailed sketches of them, that would help me greatly.

Travel southeast of here, to the Carrionite camps across the road. Sketch each of the three tribal totems found within the camps. Hopefully, from there we will gain some insight into what motivates these savages so that we can use their beliefs against them!

Thankfully, they let me go without a scratch, but all of my emerald salts were "taken as payment" by the Carrionites.

Title=Spiketail Rib Bones
BodyText=Welcome, friend! Dustshore has potential! Can you not feel it?

I could use a large favor. I supply various parties around the continent with Spiketail rib bones. Their bones are strong, but also flexible. They are used in a wide variety of items, including furniture and even weapons. I have found myself short of the required amount that I need to fill my latest order. Would you collect a dozen ribs for me? You can find various types of Spiketails all over Dustshore - you can bring me ribs from any of them.

Title=Fears of an Alliance
BodyText=You have come at a time of need, friend!

We find ourselves short of willing souls to help with our Anubian problem along the coast. The sailors from the wrecked ships prove little danger, but the camp of treacherous Anubian spies is what brings me worry.

The camp to the far south of the Windswept Coast is a hive of Scouts and Operatives. More than just warriors, they are creatures of intrigue and guile. I fear Usi, their leader, may try to make a pact with the Outcasts. Usi proves as deft with his tongue as he is with a blade. If any beast could convince the barbarian Outcasts to rally to his own flag, it would be Usi for sure.  If this were to happen, it would cause unknowable damage to our efforts to retake the Cazador Tunnel.

We have even recently seen Anubians in and around the Stonelion camps to the east of the Adventurers' Guild Camp. I want you to go to the Stonelion Camps and see if you can find anything that would prove my fears true. While you appear able to handle most of the Outcasts in this area, if you should encounter their local leader Gar Fireclaw, be wary! He is a dangerous foe! Though if there truly is any proof of an alliance to be found then it is likely Gar would be the one to have it.

More and more frequently, our outpost for peace is a target of Carrionite attacks. I fear that our peaceful message is falling on deaf ears and that they plan to take us out permanently!

The best defense is preparation! Long ago, I placed a trusted friend in Vulturia as a spy, but his identity is soon to be discovered, so we must act quickly!

Let me make an introduction; you are speaking to the Royal Epicurean, chef to the King of Camelot! I travel the world searching for exotic spices and recipes with which to stun the royal family and those who attend the feasts at Camelot.

Most recently, I am tracking down the ingredients for a recipe I wish to try at the next feast, Slug Fritters! You will love these as they crackle when you add salt to them!

Care to help gather the ingredients? First, look for Lucid Crystalcreepers near Crystal Shores Lake and harvest Translucent Flesh Samples from a dozen of them.

The time has come, then, and sooner than I thought!

Sneak into the Carrionite camps to the west and a bit north of here. Within, you will find Carrionite nests, full of fertilized eggs, ready to hatch this season's brood. They will eventually be trained as implements of death, to be used against our brothers. I plan to change that and save as many lives as we can.

Take these Carrionite eggs - unfertilized ones - and swap them out for the eggs in two nests within the camps.

We will raise the younglings in Oslis and teach them peaceful ways, while the warlike Carrionite Tribes will eventually die out. This plan takes patience, but it will be worth it!

Follow my notes and read them for instructions on what to do next.
CompleteText=Very good work. I will make sure these are hatched safely back in Oslis.

Now there is more work to be done.

Are you ready to gather the ingredients for Sphinx' Crab Delight? Worry not, no actual sphinxes will be harmed in the making of this dish - you might get bruised however.

I need you to gather some Sphinx-Tail Ale from the Windswept Shores, on the western edge of Dustshore. When the Anubian fleet shipwrecked on the coast, they lost quite a bit of their cargo in the wreckage, and among the supplies was an entire shipment of Sphinx-Tail Ale. The Anubians might be heartless killing machines, but I would swear on my favorite spoon as to the quality of their ale!

Now, if you are ready to experience greatness as a chef, bring me the following; twelve bottles of Sphinx-Tail Ale. You will find them buried in the sand all along the coast of Windswept Shores, and I would bet in the camps of the Anubian sailors. The best part, and what makes this recipe SO special, is crab meat from Ambercoast Scuttlers. I will need fifteen Scuttler Legs.

Hurry back! I will start the broth now to get a head start!
CompleteText=You are truly a marvelous aid! I am sure this will be the best dish ever tasted by beast-kind!

BodyText=The evidence is clear; the crystals do indeed have an affect on the creatures in and around the lake. However, the mutations do not appear to be malignant, but have a purifying effect upon the blood.

This could be ground-breaking news in the fight against diseases - I must know more!

Closer to Oslis to the southeast is a series of rock formations within which you will find Plateau Fleshstingers.

With great care to avoid their stings, gather a dozen mandibles from these creatures and return to me. I want to know if distance from Crystal Shores Lake makes the mutation weaker.
CompleteText=Wonderful, now I can complete my research.

Thank you very much!

Title=Rajour's Folly
BodyText=Hail. You are not unknown to me. However, word has spread among the Circle of your ability. Perhaps you would do me a favor?

Many ages ago this land was called "Rajour" and it was known as a jeweled oasis, rich in trade and fair weather. The destiny of the land changed in the course of one evening, based upon the impatience of one spoiled noble who discarded a humble and tarnished lamp as garbage. A servant, hoping to put the lamp to a more utilitarian use, set to polishing the artifact, and in doing so unleashed legions of once-trapped Djinn into Rajour.

For the Djinn, dismantling the vast empire and all its riches was a simple matter and accomplished before the next dawn. The stones and wealth of the entire empire were used by the Djinn to build a home of their liking, and therefore we have the Djinn Temple on the northern coast.

Intelligent beasts know to stay clear of the temple, though every now and again some hero decides that they will be the one to take it down. I hold no such grand delusions, no disrespect to your own abilities, of course.

What I want is a favor, for which I will pay you as a representative of the Grey Circle. An object of extreme importance has been taken by a foolhardy adventurer who we believe to have perished in an attempt at cleansing the Djinn Temple.

There will be plenty of Djinn to deal with, if that is to your liking, yet I beg of you, return to me with the Orb Of Enlightenment, as it is the only treasure we are interested in. Any other spoils you may come across are yours to keep - that is, of course, if Lord A'Frott pays no mind.
CompleteText=Very well done. I can promise you, this will not be forgotten by me, or by the Grey Circle.

It is a large, magically imbued gemstone that is currently in the possession of Rumpelstiltzskin. Yes, he is not just a myth, but indeed a living... ...ahem... ...unliving being. He is a lich, an outcast of sorts. He fell from the 'good graces' of the Abidan over some matter of Undead politics. I am sure it had something to do with Vampires, but who can say. Now he lives in the lowest level of Rupunzel's Tower. Terrible story, that tower, though I am not the one to tell it. Now where was I... Oh yes, the Crystal Heart! Rumplestlitzskin took the Crystal Heart from Bazdeen the Light. You see, Bazdeen was a great mage, but he was out-matched in trying to kill Rumplestiltzskin, even with the Crystal Heart bolstering his attacks. That was two-hundred years ago and so the Crystal Heart has sat in the tower in the bony grasp of Rumplestiltzskin. If you would, defeat Rumpelstiltzskin and bring me the Crystal Heart, and I will reward you very well.

Title=The Sound Of Thunder
BodyText=Tell me, friend, can you imagine the sound of thunder if I asked you to? The blight upon the Great Forest has caused immeasurable pain amongst the Treekin, and it can be heard in their songs. Such dark operas scream like thunder to those who can hear them, and here in Box Blight, the sound nearly drowns out all others! It is enough to drive any beast with a heart to madness!

In our studies of Khazeekela's efforts in mutating the Treekin into the Rotted, we know that she intended to keep them as some sort of slave-race. Khazeekela planned to strip the Treekin of their will and use them as a force of revenge against the People of the Skull who exiled her. It is a bitter blessing that the newly born Rotted would not bend to her will, but kept their own, even when plagued. Therefore, there was no Rotted army, but still the Great Forest dies around us!

Since this blight upon our land and brethren was not created by Gaia, but beast-wrought, I believe this to be potentially reversible!

Kazeekela worked alone and in secret, but it is rumored she kept notes about her research on the Black Shroomies and the creation of the rotted hidden about Deadwood in Rotted Groves.

There are three Rotted Groves south of Greenline Thicket, within Box Blight. Search each of the Rotted Groves; one in the Southwest, one in the South, and one in the East of Box Blight for any sign of Khazekeela from the past.

Return to me in Greenline Thicket when with your findings.

Wind at your back, friend.
CompleteText=Success? You found tablets? Gaia be praised, this looks to be notes, of sorts, that Khazekeela made regarding her attempts to corrupt the Treekin! I must look at this deeper and perhaps I can find a cure!

Thank you and farewell friend!

They capture healthy Treekin seedlings and take them to the Rotted Nursery.

Once these Treekin awaken and have sprouted, the Black Shroomies and Rotted on hand are able to corrupt the young seedlings. The Treekin seedlings will know not much more than a few moments of true life, before succumbing to the disease and a life of unknowable pain.

Whatever lurks south of us in Deadwood, grievous fungal abominations and disease, Beasts like us walk into it together like always, with a stiff upper lip! Are you ready for such duty, comrade?

On the southern border of Box Blight, in the mountains north of Bleeding Sap, Rot-Corrupted Dire Wolves prowl and make passage south difficult, to say the least.

The natural cave entrance to the Forest Cave is littered with the bones of the pack's previous kills and grows every day as they become bolder.  It is not just the corrupting force of the "rotted plague" which makes this den a particular threat, but there is a sad tale surrounding the pack as well.

Lady Silvermane, once a respected citizen and soldier, lost her kits to the dire wolves of that den. The loss drove her to madness and she searched for them for months until she found the den. We believe her to have "gone feral" and that she lives with the pack of dire wolves within, hunting with Foul Fur and believing the den's pups to have been reincarnations of her own.

Travel to this Forest Cave, friend. Once you arrive, enter within and seek out Lady Silvermane, and the dire wolf pack leader Foul Fur. End Foul Fur's reign of terror and relieve the Lady Silvermane of her dismal plight for good. The Lady Silvermane was once a cherished friend and I cannot bear to think of her enduring such a twisted existence.
CompleteText=So it is done? I am saddened at the passing of Lady Silvermane, but glad in my heart she is finally at peace. Please take this reward for shouldering this most dreadful task.

Behind me is the Bileforge. The name speaks for itself. It is truly a forge for much of the rot and decay that now consumes the forest, but we can shut the place down, or at the very least slow its production.

The Bileforge has an overseer, Baddyr. He is a vicious Rotted that delights in the decay and death the Bileforge brings. Eliminating him will be a huge boon to our cause.

Of course, getting to him in order to eliminate him has a catch. He secrets himself away on one of the high platforms that has no direct access. Instead, there is a Summoning Stone that will transport his allies up to meet with him. The stone is only usable by Rotted and Shroomies - until now. I have found a way to trick the stone!

First, however, I need some components in order to make this work.

Enter the Bileforge and collect three Vile Spore Pods. They grow around the edge of the bubbling pool.
CompleteText=Perfect, these will do just fine.

It will take me a while to brew the concoction. In the mean time, I have another task for you.

Title=The Struggle
BodyText=This camp is our front line in the war with the Rotted. It is here, friend, we make the long stand against the corruption of the Rotted King and his army of corruptors. However, to understand where the future may lead, young one, you must know the full truth of the past.

Long before the beasts returned, we, the Treekin, slept. In our slumber, a witch came to this forest, an exile of her own people. She was Khazekeela. She sought revenge on her own kin for casting her out. She became our slumbering nightmare. Twisting the forest and my own kin into creatures of corruption and fearsome brutishness, and still we slept. She wanted an army of slaves to scourge her own homeland. At first, her attempts failed, but she was not dissuaded. She pressed on, her dark magic soaking deeper into each of my sleeping brothers that she used for her own wicked aims. It was then that she found her success. It was Ambervane, that fell to the darkness, pushed deep into his bark until he could not withstand the darkness, the corruption, the decay. She had succeeded and, in doing so, the Rotted were born. His own dream fading into the living nightmare, Ambervane awoke from the long slumber. He gazed upon Khazekeela. She cast her magics about him, an attempt to enslave his spirit, but to no avail. She had indeed corrupted his soul, but his will was still his own. In that moment, without a thought, he crushed the life out of her. His touch alone, rotting her flesh to the bone, until there was little but dust remaining. He gazed about. He was not alone. Many other sleeping Treekin had been brought to the maze deep in the wood. He touched one of our brothers and watched, with no horror at all, as the corruption spread from his own hand to the hand of his brother, quickly consuming, engulfing, possessing the dreamer. His path was set and he soon found he was not alone. The Black Shroomies came to him offering a pact - a Pact of Decay. To turn the wood into the festering, putrid, dying hulk it is today. In the ages that have passed, we have had successes and failures in this fight, but still we push on. Knowing that in the end it shall be our deaths, or the salvation of the forest. This is our way. This is our struggle. This...is our life.

To know the struggle is to better understand it. This is the fight you now seek to join. I tell you this so you have no illusions about what is to come, now that you know what has come before. Think on this and then return to me. If you wish to truly join this fight, then after you have considered this, we may proceed.
CompleteText=So you wish to join the fight? Good, then let us begin.

I spoke of Khazekeela, now ages dead at the hand of her own creation. Though she is gone there are some who, to this day, hold her in high regard among your own kin. Yes, friend, beasts who worship the long dead witch. Troubling, terrible, and confusing. All the more reason for one who is of their own ilk to take action. 
They call themselves the Khazechek. They have infested the remains of the lost town in the Bleeding Sap. They must be dealth with. We have many worries from the Pact of Decay, we can do without cultists, worshiping a dead witch, to further worry us.
I ask you first to investigate the old ruin at the end of the road to the west. It is outside the proper heart of the Bleeding Sap but of late we have been told of strange occourances and my brethern have told me of a chill that haunts them when they approach. This chill did not arrive until these cultists came to the Bleeding Sap. Very odd indeed.

So go now. Search the old ruin, and return when you feel you have more to tell me.

I think they know she is too strong for us and hope she will let us be if we ignore her.

I do not believe it is ever a good policy to ignore threats at your front door and now that you are here, we can take care of the vile bug!

Search for a huge fallen tree northeast of here, to hunt her down and take out as much of her brood as you can.

Title=The Hand
BodyText=This book is very old. Written in a language few, even of my kin, remember. It is full of terrible, dreadful evil. A means of summoning the spirits of those long gone. There are recent notes written within these pages. Dreadful, disturbing, horrible. The leaders of the Khazachek believe they have the skeletal hand of Khazekeela herself. I can tell you whatever this hand is, it is not the hand of Khazekeela. What they will summon is not known to me, if indeed they try. Even so, we cannot allow yet another abomination to be loosed in the forest.

Go to the Bleeding Sap. If this hand is in any soul's possession, it would be one of the two leaders. Smite them both and find this hand.
CompleteText=You return, young one. Indeed, this is not the hand of Khazekeela, but it is quite strange. The hand has the feel of raw power. To whomever it once belonged, I cannot say. Take the hand to Rose Farwalker. She is a Redeemer and is far more familiar with the workings of the Unliving than I.

Just before reaching the camp, I was attacked by those crazy cultists that now inhabit the old town in the Bleeding Sap. They took a chest from me that holds a trinket of little actual value, but it has dear meaning to me. It is a dreamcatcher, locket that has been handed down through generations in my family. If you are heading into the Bleeding Sap, I would appreciate it if you could seek out the chest that holds my dreamcatcher and return it to me.
CompleteText=Oh, thank you! Thank you! I would be lost without this.

BodyText=You have proven yourself a valuable aid and now I must ask you for one final act of valor.

We must reclaim the tunnel to Cazador. The remaining forces in Spain can only hold back the Anubian horde for so long before they will need reinforcements. Those reinforcements will not arrive unless we can reopen the Cazador Tunnel.

To do this, you must defeat the force holding the inside of the tunnel. To do that, you must defeat General Thothmes, the leader of the Anubian force. He is no normal Anubian - his armor is imbued with powerful magic beyond my own reckoning. During the initial invasion of Dustshore, he alone slew groups of men single-handedly.

I ask you to do this not for me, but for the lives of those brave men who will die if we do not get more men and supplies to Cazador as soon as possible!

Go now and may Gaia watch over you!
CompleteText=You have done yourself and this land a great deed. This will not be forgotten. I shall speak with Arthur of your deeds, personally, the next chance I have to visit Camelot. Take this key and use it to unlock my personal chest. You may take one item from inside.

I am sure you could be of assistance to those who watch there.

Title=The Dark Depths: Djall's Vitiator
BodyText=The Dark Depths once was a glorious temple to our mother Gaia. It was place of worship, and those who honor Gaia would travel from all corners of the continent to bask in the temple's light. Young druids of every race would seek out the teachings of the wise ones who lived in and maintained the temple. It was a place of peace and knowledge.

Then came the Cleansing. Anubis and Khafre summoned the Sphinx to destroy the gods. An individual Sphinx was no match for a god, but a group of them were devastating. It was on the grounds of the temple of Gaia that five Sphinx fell upon Demeter and a terrible battle was fought. Demeter was slain and the temple was corrupted forever. The temple sank into the ground and the island was left a bleak waste. Many tried to cleanse the area, but to no avail. The damage had been done. The violent death of Demeter had left its mark.

For ages, the island had been untouched. That has changed, now. A group devoted to Djall himself has begun excavating the island. They have dug out the temple and breached the doors. They are led by one known as Aram Norr. He titles himself 'Djall's Vitiator'. He claims to speak directly to Djall. It matters little if this is true or not. His followers believe him and will die for him. His intentions can only be dark. He must be stopped. Would you brave the Dark Depths to stop him?
CompleteText=He is slain? Then you are to be commended. Take this key. It will allow you to open the Oak Chest next to me. You may take one reward from inside the chest. Thank you and farwell.

When you return the journal to Spencer, do give him my regards.
CompleteText=You have the journal? I... I have not touched this book for such a long time.  This was once a gift from my late wife. I know it may sound trivial to you, but I have missed this book every day for many years. She was my life. I miss her everyday, still.

(You decline to tell him about how you obtained the journal.)

Thank you friend. This does indeed bring me a small glimmer of happiness.

Title=Speak to the Warden
BodyText=Hello traveler.  My name is Spencer Gallows. I am a doctor, of sorts, and I once lived in Bremen. I worked in the Bremen Asylum before it was closed up for good. The place was once a haven for those who, for whatever reason, had need of care not for the body, but for the mind. Some were bewitched, others had just gone plain mad. It was a peaceful place, though, until one night something went terribly wrong. A new patient had arrived. He was a man obviously shaken by some traumatic event. He kept going on and on about "...east...always east...," or talking about demons and generally not making much sense.

I am still not even sure what happened. What I do know is from his room that night came screams of terror. Most of us fled when the entire place began to shake. Those who did not escape went mad within hours. I lost...friends...that day. That was over ten years ago. Prince Emberson tried to reclaim the place but every attempt ended badly. Eventually, it was just closed up tight. Still, at night you can sometimes hear screams of pain or insanity coming from the inside. Sorry I have rambled on quite a bit. I have need of someone to reenter the asylum. It may sound trivial but I left behind a journal there. My reasons for wanting it back are my own, but I do wish it returned to me. I am not ashamed to say I do not bear the mark of bravery required to even think of entering that place, now. You, on the other hand, look like the adventurous type. You can gain entrance to the asylum if you speak with Verlos Clarron, the former warden of the asylum. He keeps watch on the place to this very day.
CompleteText=What do you want? Gallows sent you? Hmm...

BodyText=Welcome, welcome. I am Brossk Vir. I am the defacto leader of Bazaart. We never had a true leader, and so I just began to organize things one day. Next thing I know, everyone is asking me about everything and I just kind of ended up running the show. That is not important, though! What is important is a sense of brewing trouble with the Djinn. They have kept to themselves for a long time, but I am being told more Djinn have been coming out of the temple. The Djinn at the Oasis have always been there, but they are mere pups compared to the powerful Djinn of the temple. Perhaps Lord A'frott has just grown bored, or has a growing blood lust. Either way, we cannot allow the entire region to be overrun by the Djinn. I would ask you to undertake the most dangerous task of slaying Lord A'frott. He is a very ancient Djinn and I can assure you, he will not go down without a fight. If you will do this, I would urge you to find others to aid you. While I do not wish to question your ability, I can assure you that alone, you will be no match for the temple or Lord A'frott.
CompleteText=You did it? Oh my! Oh my...not that I am surprised, mind you, but I am surprised! Please, take this key and use it to open my special rewards chest. Take one item and know you have made the entire region safer for all who live and travel here!

BodyText=Hello friend. Era and myself are both researchers of the Djinn. They are a fascinating race of creatures. If you are planning an expedition into the temple, I would ask you for a favor. There are said to be three large carved rune stones inside. I would love to get etchings of these stones to study. If you can bring me the etchings of the three rune stones, it would help my research a great deal.
CompleteText=You got them! Let me see! Hmm...interesting... ...very interesting! This will help more than I had hoped.

Thank you so much!
