Title=Find The Emerald Eggs!
BodyText=Happy Bounders Day to you! Long ago, Bounders like myself were driven from our homeland, the Emerald Kingdom, by an invading enemy who ravaged our island.

Gloomy tale, I know; but we Bounders are known for bouncing back! That's why we celebrate these events with Bounders Day; a day where Emerald Eggs, used to commemorate our homeland and to represent the delicate nature of peace, are hidden around the city for beasts to find.

Bring me seven of these Emerald Eggs and I will provide you with some Bounder-rific rewards! 
CompleteText=I count seven Emerald Eggs, good for you! 

Has Bounders Day taught you the importance of peace and how we must strive to preserve it? Did you at least have fun looking for the eggs?!
