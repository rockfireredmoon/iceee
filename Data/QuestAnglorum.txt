Title=Hides, Shells and Feathers
BodyText=Oh! Hello there! Perhaps you could help me with a small amount of work I need done? I would gladly pay you for your efforts.

I am a trader, you see. I take bits and pieces of creatures here in Anglorum over into Midlands and beyond to trade for other such creature bits, or just to sell. Normally, I have my man-servant, Aramere, do the collection of these things for me. But sadly, he is off on other business for me at this time, though he should be back by now! Hrmph!

So, if you have the time and could use some coin, I could use some Barbhog Hides, Lake Crab Shells and some Tailfeathers from the nasty little Razor-Talons that seem to infest this area - a half dozen of each should do just fine!
CompleteText=You return! And I see you have my goods! Excellent! Take your reward and thank you very much!

I got a small bit distracted and wandered into a pack of chompers - dreadful thing in fact. Locally, they call them Meadow Munchers - silly name! Ah, but to the point... There is one in particular that has caused me some grief. I think Boyle named him, even - Clampton! Well... *sigh* ...he ate my favorite sword. Yes, I know... Would you do me the great favor of hunting this pest down and retrieving my sword from his belly? Gaia only knows if I will even be able to use it again, but we shall see. Would you do this for me?

Title=Thornbringers Investigation
BodyText=Welcome to Stonehenge. I am glad you have been sent to us. We surely can use help with some local issues.

More specifically, I need some help dealing with a group calling themselves "Thornbringers". Though they would appear to be Druids, like myself, they bring not life, but decay to all things around them.

They have infested the shores south of the henge and seem to be spreading daily. I have yet to ascertain what their true purpose is, or even who the leader is amongst their ranks.

Do me the favor of investigating their camps taking any documents that you may find. I must know who is behind this incursion and what exactly their aims are.
CompleteText=You found something? Hrm... ...that name sounds familiar. Allow me some time to research this a bit further. In the meantime, talk with Druid Kearn; he has some related issues to discuss with you.

Sadly, I do not have the time to hunt and collect the more rare items I need to build the bows. I would pay you for your efforts, if you could collect these items for me. This is not as simple as it seems. I need fine Buck antler for the bow and well hardened quills for my arrows. You would need to hunt an Elder Buck for the antler and one of the larger Quillback patriarchs for the quills. How about it?

Title=Bandit Connection?
BodyText=Ah Christie sent you? Good, I can use some help!

I was sent from Camelot by Grand Druid Lunast. He is convinced the local Thornbringer situation is also related to the sudden rise of the River-Runner bandits. Previously, they were a source of little concern, doing little more than occasionally waylaying a passersby here and there on their way to Camelot. Recently, however, they have grown in not only numbers, but have gone as far as taking over some farmland south of Camelot itself!

I am convinced there is a connection between the Thornbringers and the sudden rise of these bandits, as well. I have heard that a bandit messenger has been seen just south of the road. That same area seems to be visited quite regularly by one of the Thornbringers. Perhaps this is a message drop between the two? Investigate for me and let me know what you find. I can only act, in a more direct manner, if I have proof!
CompleteText=Ah, just as I thought! Jek and Jester Jumptail; mostly buffoons, but with enough resources, it seems, they can cause quite a large amount of mayhem.

Title=Aid to Druid Byrne
BodyText=First, allow me to welcome you to our fair city of Camelot.

Now that we have dispensed with the simple pleasantries, let us get to the heart of the matter.

"Priestess" Claira is what she is calling herself these days? I see.

Claira was once an acolyte in our order. She had talent, but she did not have the will to be taught or guided. She seemed to have little care for our ways and began to seek out powerful magics. I cautioned her against this. Yet, she persisted. I found in her possessions a book written by, of all things, a lich named Alimat. Where she could have possibly found such a thing I have no idea. That was the final straw. I told her she must leave and not return to our order.

Now it would seem she has returned and is leading these Thornbringers. I must consult with some of the more senior members of our order before I proceed with any further action. In the meantime, I ask that you travel to the large farm south of Camelot and speak with Druid Byrne. The River-Runner Bandits have claimed the farm for themselves and Druid Byrne could surely use a hand in dealing with the situation.
CompleteText=Good day. Did Lunast send you? Ah, good. I can use some help here.

Title=The Shadow Legion
BodyText=Shadows... Long ago, some very well meaning, yet foolish souls sought a power they should never truly possess. What they sought is known as the Mysterium Primordial, a book of infinite knowledge and power locked away from comprehension by a key known as the Enigma Primal. Those that sought it were possibly the most powerful beasts to walk the Earth - the Mystarchs. Two of the Mystarchs, Al'Idrisi and Jezebel, followed the roots of Yggdrasil, the world tree, into other planes of existence in search of the Enigma Primal.

They were fools. Along the winding roots of infinite possible Earths, they found the Enigma Primal. As they claimed their prize, the Shadow came like smoke bellowing up from the cracks in the earth - whispering and grasping and following them.

To make matters worse for the Mystarchs, was that the Enigma Primal was incomplete. While yes it was the key to understanding the Mysterium Primordial, the Enigma Primal was missing a single page - intentionally torn from its binding - the very first page. The key was in fact missing its own key. To attempt to read the Enigma Primal without fully comprehending it - via its own key - was to dip into insanity. Such are the powers at play here.

It was clear this Enigma Primal was a trap deliberately set by the Shadows, or as they began to call them, the Shadow Legion.

While they did seal the Shadows out of our existence for the most part, the threat still lingers. Tears in reality from one world often cause rifts in another. When those rifts appear in our world, so do the Shadows.

If, as you say, Shadows are now at the old Dandridge Farm, then I must inform Arthur immediately. Better still, you will inform Arthur! It is about time the Hero of Earthend met the king! Go to him. Tell him what you told me and let him know that I will consult with him on this matter very shortly.
CompleteText=Greetings hero! I have heard much of you and your exploits. I am grateful for your aid.

What brings you here today?

Merlin sent you... ...Shadows? Hmmm... Another troubling happening, especially considering the other troubles we currently face. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Title=The Militia House
BodyText=The Knights of Avalon recently mounted an assault on the east shore of the Avalon Lake. Honestly, I cannot quite conceive of their exact purpose for this action. We have had an unspoken truce of sorts for many years. They did not breach the gate from their Avalonian stronghold and we in return have not attempted to enter. Mordred and Morgana have not been seen in our lands for many years. Why they decided to strike out from Avalon now is a mystery. More mysterious is the fact that they did not send elite troops. They sent a garrison or more of men, but they were not highly skilled and were easily beaten. I suspect something else is afoot. Something we are unaware of. That thought worries me.

If you wish to assist in ridding our lands of the Avalonians, then head directly to the Militia House on the south-eastern shore of the lake. The Anglorum Militia is an army of the people. They are the backbone of Anglorum's defense.

Go to the Militia House and speak with Captain Nordington. Be warned, he is a harsh but fair captain. If he is reluctant to even accept your help, just mention that Arthur sent you. I assure you that will, at the very least, make him reconsider any initial doubts he may have of you.

Good luck and farewell.
CompleteText=And you are? I do not have time to talk with the likes of you. Carry on...

I was sent here by my boss, Elden Motera in Fort Stonehenge, to fetch something from the city. Unfortunately, the guards seem to have mistaken me for some miscreant! I mean, look at me! I am an upstanding citizen! Really! To the point, they will not allow me into the city. Hrmph!

Perhaps you could get the item for me. In the Slums you will find a Merga Moonseer. She is, uhm... a ...witch, perhaps is the best way to describe her... Do not worry, she is harmless, if not a bit odd! Tell her Elden sent you for his special treat! She will understand.
CompleteText=Who are you? What are you looking at, hmm? HRMM?! You looking at me? Am I a curiosity?? Oh... look, birds! I love birds... ...in a nice stew... ...with a touch of lemon... Did the lemons send you? Well, did they?!

Oh, Elden sent you! Oh, I see then, you must not be working for THEM... ...this is good, good... ...hmm... Do you hear that? Sounds like dragons! Or wait...! No just a sparrow. Mostly the same they are, anyway...

Oh, Elden's Special Treat? Oh yes, yes... ...freshly cooked, in fact, and tasty... ...tasty like fire... You ever eat fire? Not as bad as you think in fact...

We are always looking for new equipment and I do not care if they were made in Camelot or in the 'misty shores', or wherever-it-is these Avalonians come from.

Be warned; there may still be a few stragglers wandering the shores.

Now get going and make it quick!

The Avalonians still have men all up the coast and across the river. Additionally, they have infested the keep up the road.

Just past the keep is a farm. The area is still thick with stragglers. I actually think they are afraid to go back to Avalon considering the losses they already took! At the farms you might find some Barrels of Pitch. Take one of the barrels, then go to the dock on the far north section of the coast, by the mouth of the river, and burn some of the boats. Maybe taking away their chance of escape back to that island of theirs will crush their spirits!

Get moving and be quick about it!

The battlefield is now flanked by two Avalonian camps, the bulk of their remaining forces. The easiest way to kill a snake is to cut off its head! In this case, heads! Each camp is lorded over by Avalonian captains; Rancor Grindwind, a mage of considerable ability, and Pernin Ayn, a druid with a dead-eye bow shot. Both should be approached with extreme caution.

Thus far you have proven your worth far beyond my expectations. If you choose to take this mission for me, I then offer you my greatest wishes for victory!
CompleteText=I will have to travel to Camelot and thank Arthur personally for sending you to me. You are a true soldier!

As a final reward, take one of these Recipes. We do not have many spare items these days, but if you can acquire all the items on the Recipe list, you can have a crafter in one of the towns create it for you!

She is the leader of these malcontents and the horror they wrought, which you saw first hand in the crypt. This is more than enough reason to act.

We now know she is deep in the Underhenge, an old shrine under Stonehenge. It was left many years ago to decay due to its structural instability. Go to the Underhenge and put an end to Claira.
CompleteText=Again you return unharmed. Gaia be praised. What is this...?

...as I thought, this is all just part of Hetius and Mali's scheming.

Hetius, Grand Fanatic Hetius as he is also known, is a follower of Hyperion. Hetius claims he himself has been to the gates of Tartarus and heard the voice of Hyperion himself. The voice gave him... instructions...

Personally, I do not believe the tale. What I do believe is he, Mali, and all their followers, DO believe that this may be the start of an even greater threat.

For now, though, I must thank you. You have done so much for our Order and this land. Please take this key to my chest in the corner. You may open it and take one item of your choosing.

Again friend, I thank you! May Gaia guide your hand, heart, and mind. Farewell.

You do? Ah, Gaia be praised! Myself and Faern here were sent here from Camelot... Well, not sent here specifically, but sent to the old Monastery.

When the bookwyrms take a new book as a body, it changes uhm... something... errr... ...well that is neither here nor there! The important thing is, we failed! I am sure Lunast thought we were up to the task, or else why would he have sent us?!

Would you perchance gather the pulp we need? I suppose Lunast would be less angry with us if we at least returned with what he asked for.
CompleteText=Praise Gaia, you brought the pulp! Now we must go and admit we failed, unless... you do not suppose he knew we could not manage to get it ourselves...? Perhaps this was a test to see how resourceful we are!

I guess we will find out soon enough.

Michalka is concerned about our 'mission'; but I am more upset that while we were running for our lives, I lost my journal. Grand Druid Lunast may be angry with us for our failure. However, he will eventually get past that; but I will be surely lost without my trusty journal. It has the chronicle of my entire life in its pages! I fear that if it stays too long outside the Monastery, that one of the bookwyrms may turn my journal into its next set of wings! So please, I beg you, go to the Abandoned Monastery and find my journal. It should be outside in the old graveyard, somewhere!

Oh sorry, just a tad bit too busy for my own good. Perhaps you can assist me? I am out of three of my most popular herbs. Two are rather easy to obtain, though difficult to find; the third requires you to fell some nasty little beasts. Care to help me?

Great! What I need is Petite Swamp Barbs. They grow just along the edges of the swamp to the southeast of town. I also need a handful of Wrath-Thorn Barbs. Your best bet for finding those lovelies is down by the old Monastery. I tend not to go there myself, that place gives me the creeps, but it is a great place to find Wrath-Thorn growing wildly! Finally I need some Wandering Earth Moss. This one is a little tricky: Wandering Earth Moss is called that because it grows on the backs of Earth Trudgers. They are quite large, but I think you are more than a match for them! You will find them a bit north of the Monastery, so at least you will already be in the area collecting my Wrath-Thorn Barbs!
CompleteText=You are back! Great! Now I can fill these orders.

Check back later, I may have more herbs for you to hunt down for me!

Title=The Fate of Baron Unger
BodyText=Greetings traveler. I am Lady Kathryn Rose, of the House of Rose. My family has lived in Bath and owned much of the surrounding land for many years. Our family has seen many highs and lows and it is a current low that I wish to discuss with you.

This regards my uncle, Baron Unger. While it is common for him to be very much a hermit, I now have grown to worry about his well being. He lives high on the hill in the Overwatch Keep. Once a watch post, it was deeded to our family many years ago. Uncle Unger took the place as his own private sanctuary in which to study. I fear that his studies have gone from the mere hypothetical to the real. He was always obsessed with Beast consciousness; asking "What makes us self aware in ways that more common creatures are not?". People spoke of him doing experiments on local creatures.

I have not heard a word from him in over three months. I sent a servant to speak with him - the servant never returned. I sent some of the local militia to speak with him - they returned with horrible news. It would seem the entire keep is overrun with strange creatures and they could not get inside to see if my uncle was there.

I ask of you to go to the keep and discover the fate of Baron Unger. If he lives, ask him to return to Bath. If the unthinkable has happened and he has... passed ...then please return his ring - the Rose Family Signet - to me, so that I may at least have something to remember him by.

If you would do me this great favor I will be ever thankful.
CompleteText=You have returned - what news?

Oh...you have brought me his ring.

This is a sad day for my family. To you, though, I must give thanks. You have at least let me know the fate of my uncle and I can begin to mourn his passing. Please take this reward for your efforts.

Title=The Treasure Map
BodyText=While you were gone, I had searched for some way to reward you for your efforts. I came across this old riddle of a map that promises to hold great treasure to the one who can solve it. It has been in the family for many years, though I am not sure any of my kin were adventurous enough to even seek out the prize. I cannot say exactly what could lay at the end, but perhaps an adventurer like yourself could find out?

Take it and see if you can solve it. If perchance you do, please return to me and let me know what you discover at the end.
CompleteText=What's this? A key... oh and it has our family seal on it! I know what this key is for! I just never thought I would ever see it! An heirloom chest passed down from family member to family member with a riddle of sorts. It was said that one day the key would be found. That was all! I suppose the whole time the map was just a way to find the key! You have earned the right to open the chest, adventurer, and take whatever may be inside!

(You prudently choose not to detail all the troubles you went through just to get the key...)

This time, it seems to be pointing to a spot somewhere deep in the middle of Sherwood Forest and just north of the Moors.

(That last clue was a doozy, yet you bring yourself to look for that mark again. Sure enough, it has now moved to a location on the northern shores of Avalon Lake just south of the Moors. You happen to notice an island in the lake seems to be located just south of the spot indicated. If this clue is correct, your rather long trek around Anglorum may finally be nearing its end.)

Title=The Bog Rats
BodyText=Recently, we've been having a bit of a bandit problem. The buggers have been attacking travelers heading toward Bath. They call themselves the Bog Rats - how appropriate for the swamp scum that they are. Their leader is named Floro, or as he much prefers 'Floro the Sly' - feh! Sly my eye! He is nothing more than a thug that needs to be dealt with harshly.

They have control of a fairly large area at the edge of the swamp. They have taken the small farm here and even have an encampment out on the island south of the farm.

The most important thing is to rid ourselves of Floro. He is the ringleader. Without him, the rest will most likely scatter to the winds. The problem is I cannot seem to catch him. I have seen him enter the farm house and then seem to vanish. There must be some secret basement in that place, but I am unable to find it.

I want you to assault their camps. Kill fifteen of them - that'll let them know how seriously we've taken thieving in these parts. At the same time, keep your eyes open for clues as to how to enter the basement of that farm house. I think our only chance of catching Floro is to get him while he is in there with no other way to escape.

BodyText=Let me see... hmm... Yes, I am in need of more herbs... Well, ok, these are not exactly herbs, but I do still need them to be hunted down and collected. Though hmm... these are quite a bit more dangerous to gather, but if you are interested, I will pay you as best I can!

Great! I need mosquito wings... not just any old mosquito wings either, but I need wings from the Swampside Bloodfiends to the north. Be warned, they are not called Bloodfiends for nothing, they are quite dangerous - approach with caution!

I also need some very specific salamander tails. Locally, they call them Bogbeasts... hah! Just over sized lizards!

Finally I need some Seacrab Eyes. Yeah, I know - eew! I have a monthly order for them from someone living in Nottingham - who knows? I just sell the stuff!

Good luck!

Title=The Gloom Witches
BodyText=Good day, friend. I hope I am not bothering you, but I am in quite a predicament. I have been a fool and now I fear I may pay for my foolishness with my very soul! You see, I met this traveler on the road. She was kind, sincere and beautiful, so I was not at all adverse to having her travel the road with me. She said she knew a shortcut to Nottingham through the swamp! I must admit, I should have known something was wrong right then, but I suppose I was taken in by her charms. I agreed to follow her on this 'shortcut'. Next thing I know, she disappeared into the fog and I am standing at some old shack in the swamp, surrounded by Gloom Witches! Yes, Gloom Witches, here in Anglorum! Then darkness! I awoke sometime later in a cavern. The Gloom Witches were there! They were chanting some mojo I could not quite understand and I felt a retching pain. One of them spoke to me and told me she had just stolen a piece of my soul and put it in some big blue bottle! I am not sure if she was serious or just trying to scare me. Then they set me free! I ran with all haste back here to the inn! This cannot be allowed to continue! I talked to the guards and local militia, but they do not seem to believe me! So, friend, I beg of you! Go into the swamp, to that shack, and destroy the vile Gloom Witches. And if you can, get back that piece of my soul! I think the cave was under the shack, but it is all a bit of a blur... Please, do what you can!
CompleteText=Hello again. Yes, I 'felt' - something, I think...maybe... ...either way, I am better now knowing you put an end to those horrible creatures! Allow me to reward you for all you have done; take one of these items. Thank you and farewell.

Act.BodyText=You found a book that mentions a Glindergloom. There are two entries: One is a mushroom that is native to most of the continent. The other is a wand that can be fashioned, also known as Glindergloom. To fashion Glindergloom, you need three components: A Petrified Twig, a Perfect Ruby Eye of Earth and the toe bone of a Black Lich. The three pieces must be placed in a Putrefied Urn to fashion Glindergloom. You can only assume Teressa Doomfeather wants that wand.
Petrified Twigs are commonly created by Mossback Sliders, which are large snails found in the swamp. Something in their excretions turns common twigs into rock-hard, Petrified Twigs. Search the swamp near the Mossback Sliders for a Petrified Twig.
Ruby Eye of Earth is the eye of an earth elemental also found in the swamp. A Perfect Ruby Eye, though, would require one from the elder earth elemental, Grohlum.
The toe bone of a Black Lich requires you know where to find a Black Lich! Search the undead ruins just south of the road through the swamp. It is rumored that a Black Lich has made those ruins his home.
If you can find these three things, then you must find a Putrefied Urn. As luck would have it, there is such a thing in the lands of Anglorum, but the text mentions that it is near the entrance to Coldstorm Cavern, which is just north of here.
If you truly wish to chase away the dooms, then you have quite a journey ahead of you.

Title=Trouble in Nottingham
BodyText=Hail and well met. You are new to Nottingham, yes? I need an outsider to help me with a troubling issue.

This entire area is lorded over by Wilem Grays, though he prefers the moniker of Sheriff of Nottingham. At first his appointment by the crown was a blessing; he was ruthless with the local bandits and fair with the people. But then something changed. He began to levy larger and larger taxes on the local people. If they could not pay, he would toss them in the dungeon. In recent months, some people have gone missing entirely, and the more I investigate, the more it seems the Sheriff may be responsible.

The guards here in the town I know are fair men, but to the north there are camps of "Sheriff's Deputies" - more like thugs - used to enforce the taxes. The Sheriff himself has not been seen for months. He never leaves his keep atop the mount.

I am in a tough situation. I must respect the Sheriff's authority, but I cannot sit idly by and watch him terrorize the people. My missives to the crown have thus far gone with no response. Would you help me find out just what has happened to the Sheriff?

I know that I should not broach this, as I could meet a similar fate as those who have disappeared, yet I do so for the sake of the people of Nottingham. To the west of town, deep into the middle of Sherwood Forest, you will find a small settlement. There you will find one who also seeks to get to the bottom of this problem. His name is Robin Hood. Both he and his group of Merry Beasts have done much for the people of the town while the Sheriff has become all the worse.

Head to Robin's Camp and meet with him. Perhaps both of you can do what I cannot. I beg you, for the sake of the people of Nottingham, find out what you can regarding the Sheriff's change of heart and what can be done about it.
CompleteText=Well met, friend. I am Robin. What can I do for you?

Title=The Amulet
BodyText=Hello traveler. I stand here and look at the Broken Tower, knowing the dangers that lurk inside, yet yearning for the knowledge stored up in its walls. Do you know the story of the Tower? You see, many years ago it was once a centre for magical learning. While many in Anglorum have taken up the ways of druidic study, some search for more elemental power without the burdens of joining the Order and praising Gaia with the rest of that lot. The Tower was taken over by a Lisian mage known as Sneath. He sought to train the best and brightest, to be a new generation of mages with real power. All was well until one day - boom! - something happened inside the Tower. The earth shook and many of the surrounding structures sank into the lake. Not long after, Merlin arrived and looked very displeased. He entered the Tower. Several hours later he came back outside with most of the students of The Tower. He then declared the Tower sealed and simply left. The door would no longer open and not even the entrance teleportation device would function.

There was much speculation as to what happened. Some say Merlin was the cause of the entire thing. Some say Sneath tapped into some unknown power. No one is really sure, especially now that time has passed. I know the truth of it, though. I was there all those years ago. I can tell you Merlin was not to blame. In fact, without his help, many more may have died.

Sneath was not an evil soul, but he did crave power. He sought all throughout the world for items of such power, so as to make that power his own and to teach that power to others. It was this craving that would be the end of the Tower. A stranger brought Sneath a book one day. He told Sneath it contained some of the wisdom of the Mystarchs. This surely got Sneath's attention and for days he languished in his study transcribing every character, every rune, every single word. This went on for nearly two weeks before Sneath emerged. He told us he had unlocked some secrets long forgotten and that a new era was at hand. This was the start of a very lengthy speech. As he spoke, he seemed more and more ill at ease, as if each word was taking more and more effort, and then he collapsed. We took him to his bed and let him rest.

Late that night there was a terrible rumble in the Tower, followed by a horrifying scream of agony from Sneath's room. We rushed in only to find him standing in the middle of the room surrounded by crackling energy. Again he began to speak, but his voice was not his own. In his hands was the book the stranger had brought and before him an urn filled with the dust of the dead, putrid and glowing a sickly green. Seemingly possessed, Sneath began to speak words I still have yet to comprehend, and all around me my friends began to wither and die. My own cowardice rushed up in me and I ran for my life. Halfway down the hall, I nearly ran into Merlin, who was rushing toward Sneath's room. What transpired after that, I do not know. It was hours later that Merlin emerged with the book and a few more students. Merlin then cast some magic and sealed up the door, after which, he then deactivated the teleporter as well. Though its flame still burns, it simply does not work any longer.

Over the years, I have sought answers from Merlin; but he had nothing to say to me, except to leave matters be. But I cannot. If Sneath still lives, I want revenge. He murdered my friends - my best friends and I did nothing to stop him. I have devoted my life to learning the ways of magic in hopes of returning inside the halls of the Tower, the Broken Tower, as they call it now. Though I have found no way to breach the ground floor door, I do believe I have found a way to reactivate the teleporter. Sadly, I am now aged and weak, too weak to ever find answers, or get my vengeance.

Would you be my vengeance? Would you accept my plea to enter the Broken Tower and slay Sneath, if he still lives?

Reactivating the teleporter is no easy feat; though, there is a way to break Merlin's enchantment on it and make it function for you. To make the key, I need something very special: a Black Lich's wand. I have searched for many years to find how to obtain such a thing. In the ruined castle in the swamp, there is a very old altar where this can be done; but to do so you must first gather three amulet fragments. I have tracked them down, but they are all in the possession of powerful undead in the swamp. You must kill them and get the amulet fragments. Once you have them, you can summon a wretched Black Lich named Alimat, and retrieve his wand. With his wand I can fashion the key for you.

I know this is a lot to ask.

Once inside, be warned: Though the tower looks small on the outside, it's substantially larger inside. This was done long ago, some kind of spacial magic and I have no idea how it works, but just be warned and wary. If Sneath still lives, he will be very dangerous. Now go and exact the vengeance I can no longer fulfill myself.
CompleteText=You returned. What happened?

He was alive?! And you defeated him?!

Then my vengeance is complete. I may now die knowing that he has finally been put to the grave. I will rest easy with this thought.

Words cannot convey my thanks to you, friend. Take this key and use it on the chest beside me. Take one item of your choosing. It is the very least I can do to thank you!

Once you have put the Sheriff out of his misery, return to me. It's a sorrowful task for me to ask you to kill another beast, but there is no other recourse.

BodyText=I feared it may come to this. I cannot aid you in any way other than this: Take this key. It will allow you entry into the keep. I should not even do this, but I too cannot allow this beast - if he has been tainted by the Faeries - to continue to rule here.

Go now and good luck.
CompleteText=The news has already spread to my ears.

The people will thank you as will I thank you. Though I am still troubled at this entire affair.

Take this key, it will allow you to take one item from the chest inside my tent as a reward for you efforts.

Thank you again and farewell!
