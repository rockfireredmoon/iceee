Title=What Wonderful Stories They Were
BodyText=Greeting's welcome to Chillville! Don't let the cold bother you.. you get use to it. You'll see Winterland is a wonderful place this time of year!
Err... well it use to be until that terrible Grindle showed up... He's using some kind of dark magic to curse Winterland it's caused all sorts of problems!!

In fact I was trying to read an old Chillville tale to the children when the Holiday Tomes spouted wings and attacked us !  We managed to shoo them out of town
but now I have nothing to read to the kids!  You look well put together can you try beating down a few of the now "Holiday Horror Books" and see if the stories can be saved?
CompleteText=It worked!! The children thank you!! Here take this as a reward! Enjoy your stay in Winterland.
