Title=The Rotted Maze
BodyText=You had done much to aid in our fight, young one. Now the time has come for me to ask you to take the ultimate risk. To go into the depths of the Rotted Maze and face the fiends that dwell there.

The once grand hedge is a maze of corridors, now filled with the vile, corrupt, breeding of the Pact of Decay. Within the wither walls lies death and despair. The effective of proximity of the Rotted King, and the pure corruption, does not allow for my brethren to enter within. This is why I ask you, young one, to go into the Rotted Maze in our 'sted.

Inside, you must first kill the Lost One. The oldest and most corrupt of the Black Shroomie ilk. A festering, cankerous, evil that must be slain.

Then, you must steel you heart, friend. For beyond the decay of the Lost One lies the true face of corruption, The Rotted King himself. I can only ask you of your own free will to risk all for our cause. I can only hope you will take this one final charge from me.
CompleteText=Young one, you have proven yourself be be brave, valorous and a friend. We thank you for your bravery and hope we now can finish this long war.

Take what you will from the Treekin Chest next to me. You have earned your reward.

Farewell, friend.

Title=Eye of the Lost One
BodyText=Again, I can use your assistance! I have divined the next piece for my new wand. This piece, I am afraid, is very difficult to obtain, for it lies in the deepest depths of the Deadwood within the Rotten Maze. In the maze lurk many horrors. One such horror is the Lost One, the most ancient and putrid of the Amanita Virosa. It is from this creature that the final piece of my wand can be gained. I need one of its eyes. The Lost One lives in the center of the maze, functioning as both a source of rot and as a clear barrier to all who would seek to slay the Rotted King. If you have both the nerve and heart to penetrate the depths of the maze, and retrieve one of the Lost One's eyes, then I will reward you in a manner equal to the task.
CompleteText=You have the Eye! Friend, you are a true hero of our time. The components for my wand are now complete, but there is still work to do. To create a wand of this caliber requires it to be forged in a special way. I have much research to do. Return to me again, for I may still require help to finish constructing the wand. For now, take this key and you can open the second chest, and take one item of your choosing. Choose wisely.

While she and I never truly cared for each other, other than the respect of each other's power, I cannot allow any of my previous companion's items to fall into the hands of mortals... *ahem* ...the wrong beasts. To the east, in and around the old Rolsburg Mine, you will find the Dominion has stepped onto New Badari soil. It is in the mine you will find Vangar One-Eye. He is very ruthless and he is also in possession of Jarnsaxa's Pendant. While I have no fear he could ever tap its true power, I just cannot allow such an artifact to be loose in this world. Go to the mine and kill Vangar One-Eye. Take the pendant and return it to me. Go now! Do not delay.
CompleteText=Again, you have not failed me. Perhaps Lucius is right, you are a special one. I will put the pendant somewhere safe from the grip of those who may wish to use it for their own ends.

Title=The Quarter Note Quill
BodyText=Hail adventurer! My name is Chanticleer, Bremen's finest musician and composer! I need a stout adventurer for a most harrowing mission to retrieve the Quarter-Note Quill. It is a legendary musical artifact. It can transcribe the notes of a musician as he plays them - a wondrous item. The problem is, the quill currently resides in Rapunzel's Tower. I shall reward you well if you would retrieve it. Before you say yes, are you familiar with the story of the tower?
Long ago, these lands were ruled by the cruel Otto family. The patron of the family was a brave beast and well deserving of praise. With his death, the entire family line soon went to rot. Generations later begins the tale of the Grimm family, two brothers and their sister, Aristal. At the time, a beast known as Von Hugo was the head of the Otto family and ruler of this land. He fell in love with Aristal. She rebuked his advances, but he would not relent. The brothers were so worried for Aristal, they tried to sneak her away in the dark of night, but to no avail. Von Bruno's men caught them and took Aristal to Von Bruno, at the same time banishing the brothers from this land to the faraway lands across the frozen seas. Von Bruno forced Aristal to marry him. On their wedding day, the Brothers Grimm cursed the Otto family. They called on the power of all the gods both good and evil, real and imagined, to cause the entire family to be forever cursed. Legend tells that their pleas were heard but by strange forces normally unknown to this world. Time passed and Aristal gave birth to a baby girl named Rapunzel. On her 16th birthday she went mad - raving insane! She claimed she heard voices whispering to her and told stories of being taken away in the night! To make matters worse she seemed to have developed some kind of magical power and in her insane fury it would lash out at those around her. Von Bruno could not stand this and built a tower east of Rolsburg. He locked his own daughter in the highest reaches. The entire tower was affected by her madness. The magical power in her began to warp and change the tower into the crazed creation it is today. This would not be the end of the despair for the Otto family. Over the next few generations, the family was beset by tragedy. Two sons and a daughter followed a beast playing a pipe over the bridge to Midlands and were never seen again. Wolves were known to chase members of the family at every turn. Some members of the family fell into a deep sleep, never to reawaken. These strange things continued to happen until the entire Otto family ceased to exist, except, perhaps, for Rapunzel. Some say she is still alive in the tower, made immortal by her madness.
CompleteText=Is that it? It seems so mundane, but to touch it - yes I can feel the magic it possesses. You have not let me down. Take this key. You can use it to open the chest behind me. Take one item of your choosing and use it well! Thank you and farewell.

Title=The Trailblazers
BodyText=Beast friend of the Treekin, you have already done much in our fight against the Pact of Decay and their ilk against our forest; however, there is another matter I would like for you to deal with.

To the south of the Dire Murk at the very edge of the Great Forest you will find a portion of the forest that has been cut down. Roaming in that vicinity you will find a foolhardy group of enterprising members of your own kind who call themselves the Trailblazers. Some time ago, they came to the Treekin offering to help in our fight with the Pact of Decay. We were a bit wary of their methods, though, as they suggested we divide the forest between the healthy trees and the ones infected with decay. At length, we discussed the proposal and decided such measures were not in our interests as our goal is not only to stop the spread of the decay but to force its retreat.

The Trailblazers did not seem too pleased with our decision and eventually departed the Heartwood, their seeming venture rejected. Recently, we have received reports they have returned to our forest uninvited and have been indiscriminately cutting down everything in sight. We, the Treekin, cannot allow this to stand, yet with nearly all of our resources focused on dealing with the Pact of Decay, we have been unable to get them to stop their operation.

As much as I do not wish to make such a request, I ask that you go to the Trailblazers' encampment and thin their numbers. With fewer workers chopping down our trees, the damage done can be minimized. However, to truly get the Trailblazers to cease their activities, you must defeat those in charge as well. 

Without their superiors, the remaining Trailblazers should abandon their little venture and return from wherever it is they came. Intel says their supervisor is called simply "Babe the Blue" or some such nonsense. Then there is the Trailblazers' Foreman, Pawl. Pawl will not show himself unless their operations are disrupted and Babe the Blue will likely not make an appearance unless Pawl is eliminated.

Go now and drive these uninvited pests from the forest!
CompleteText=So, those foolhardy pests have finally been dealt with? Excellent. I greatly appreciate your handling of this matter. With the Trailblazers eliminated, the areas they affected with their incessant logging efforts can begin the slow process of recovery. In the meantime, we the Treekin will continue our efforts at holding back the Pact of Decay. For your efforts, please accept one of these with my thanks and the thanks of all in the Great Forest.

Title=The Greysun Bandits
BodyText=Hello there, Beast friend! I have been told you have decided to join us here in the Heartwood in our long fight against the Pact of Decay that continually threatens the forest. There is another threat I wish to bring to your attention, though.

We Treekin highly value our Beast allies and will do our utmost to fight alongside them. Even so, there are some members of your kind we utterly detest. Some time ago a group of ruthless thieves from your own people have decided to make the Great Forest their home and they have become quite a problem. They call themselves the Greysun Bandits and have set up several encampments all across the western spanse of the forest.

Most troublesome of all is that they have begun to patrol the one and only road leading to the town of Far Reach at the far western edge of Great Forest. We have received reports they have been plundering merchants and other travelers that attempt to travel between the Heartwood, Green Line Thicket to the east and Far Reach. This has effectively cut off our brethren in Far Reach from the rest of us.

Recently though, we have received reports that the Greysuns seem to be organizing in a far more sinister manner. If this is the case, we must find out what they are up to and stop them before they become a serious threat. Because the Pact of Decay is already a constant threat to us, we, unfortunately, do not have the resources to deal with these bandits ourselves. Thus, my request to you.

Locate five of their camps and see what they are up to. Once you have done so, return to me and tell me what you have discovered.
CompleteText=I see. It is just as I feared. If what you have seen is accurate, then not only have the Greysun Bandits become a threat, it would seem they are planning something dire against the inhabitants of Great Forest. As such they must be eliminated and soon.

Title=The Greysun Captain
BodyText=Now that the Greysun Bandits are in disarray, we must take this opportunity to deliver the final blow to these vile creatures. While Galen was indeed the Greysuns' commander, there is one whom even he took orders from. Intel has informed me that the true leader of the Greysun Bandits is a fellow named Ezra Darktouch. It was Ezra, the Captain of the Greysun Bandits, who led them into the Great Forest in the first place. We must not allow Ezra to reorganize the Greysuns or all our efforts up to now will have been for naught.

Thus, I must request that you find and eliminate Ezra Darktouch before he has the chance to rebuild his group. Intel has reported that he was last seen on the road to Far Reach. Return to me again once you have sent Ezra to meet his end.
CompleteText=So, Ezra is no more then. Thank you, beast friend of the Treekin. Without your help, we could not have taken care of those bandits. Now that both of their leaders are gone, hopefully any surviving members of the Greysun Bandits will depart our forest. If not, they should be easy to eliminate now that they are more disorganized. For your efforts, please accept one of these with my thanks and the gratitude of those who should now be able to travel to and from Far Reach without fear of being harmed. Farewell.

BodyText=So, you would like to help us in our fight here at the front lines do you? Well, perhaps you can begin by heading deep into the Deadwood and locating the three Rotted Groves within the Box Blight. These groves are tainted with the rot and serve to aid in the propagation of the black shroomie spores throughout Box Blight.

Lording over these groves are three minions of the Pact of Decay. Both Buxusbane and Volutella are often seen within the western and northeastern groves, while the third, Blighton Deadroot, is reported to make his rounds between the two eastern groves near the lake.

Head to the Rotted Groves of the Box Blight and destroy these lords of the rot and poison that is the Pact of Decay!
CompleteText=You made short work of them. Most excellent. The next task I have for you, though, will not be as easy.

Title=Wither-Root
BodyText=Now that the Rotted Groves are no longer a threat it is time to press the issue by crippling the Pact of Decay where they start.

To the south of Green Line Thicket you will find a most vile grove which we have learned is the 'breeding grounds', as it were, of the Rotted. The 'Rotted Nursery' they call it. Now, they don't multiply as Mother Gaia intended, no. The Pact of Decay's method of increasing their numbers is much more vile. I won't go into the details of what horrors are wrought within that place; however, I will tell you of a specific Rotted known as Wither-Root. This particular Rotted is a nasty fellow and many young seedlings fall prey to his machinations within that corrupted grove.

With him are two 'assistants', if you could call them that. One is a corrupted dryad named Branchesca. Reports claim she is the one who assists in the corruption process of the Treekin saplings and nurses the newly turned Rotted into powerful members of the Pact of Decay. The other is a Black Shroomie called Sparren Rotgut. This fellow lords over the others of his kind within the Nursery and directly aids in the spreading of the deadly spores which infects the saplings.

Head to the Rotted Nursery and eliminate both Branchesca and Sparren Rotgut. Once these two vile beings have been dealt with, you must find and defeat Wither-Root himself. Reports claim he will not show himself that easily; however, you might get him to come out of hiding by destroying his minions.

Return here once they have felt the true sting of death!
CompleteText=So, Wither-Root and his followers are finally destroyed? That is great news indeed. This will put a nice dent in the goals of the Pact of Decay for sure! Thank you for all your help in driving back our enemies!

You see, my supply of needles has run dry and I have been unable to procure more thanks to the recent problems in the Merchants' Guild.

Title=Sand Goliaths
BodyText=Hello once again, friend! When we last met, I told you I would ask for your help when the time was right. That time has now come. Recently, we in Bazaart have begun to actively trade with the peaceful Outcast encampment of Oslis high up in Cracked Rock in the hopes of establishing a good relationship with them. Unfortunately, our merchants have encountered a stumbling block of sorts...well, more like stumbling ROCKS to be more accurate.

You see, along the nearest road between Bazaart and Oslis at the base of the cliffs there is a large gathering of Sand Goliaths. Normally docile unless disturbed, these creatures have recently become rather aggressive and have been attacking any caravans that attempt the road between here and Oslis. I have been told the Merchants' Guild has ordered all subsequent caravans to use the more northern pass to avoid the Goliaths and more losses.

Reports claim that there is a Goliath, they call it Brewtus, that seems to have begun leading them on these raids. Do everyone in both Bazaart and Oslis this favor and travel to the base of the cliffs just southeast of Bazaart and eliminate both Brewtus and as many Sand Goliaths as you can. With the loss of their new-found leader and thinned numbers, the Goliaths will hopefully return to being mostly docile allowing the caravans to once again use the road.

Return to me once they have been dealt with.
CompleteText=Excellent work! Now that the Sand Goliaths are no longer a threat, we can reinforce our trade with Oslis. Unfortunately, we have an even bigger problem now.

Title=The Cult of the Sand Dragon
BodyText=While you were out taking care of the Sand Goliaths, we in Bazaart received some grave news.

You might have noticed the numerous piles of dragon skeletons scattered around the Dust Fields just east of Bazaart while in your travels. The large sandstone hills to the southeast are covered in them at the top and some of us here in Bazaart have come to call that place 'The Dragon's Nest'.

I assure you, this name was chosen for good reason. High atop the Dragon's Nest, lies a dragon very much alive and well. For the longest time it has slept peacefully and left the people of Dustshore and Cracked Rock alone for the most part. However, I have been informed that the creature might be awake once more.

Some time ago, a strange group of lisians moved into the Sand Fields and took residence among the dragon bones littering the land. We have been cautiously observing them because of their apparent fascination with the sleeping dragon high atop the Nest. Reports have stated they claim to be the offspring of the dragon and they worship it like a god. They have even given the dragon a name: Kerakura.

Up until recently, this so-called 'Brood of Kerakura' cult has been mostly harmless; however, now it seems they have become a threat. I have been told it seems their close proximity to Bazaart was no accident and that, with their increasing numbers, they could easily stage an attack on this town.

On behalf of the people of Bazaart and, indeed all of Dustshore and those up in Cracked Rock, I ask you to head to the encampments of the Kerakura Brood and utterly destroy them. The incursions of the Anubians in recent times have already cost us much and we do not need a bunch of cultists stirring up even more trouble. 
CompleteText=You return safely I see, but, there is yet one final task to be undertaken.

Title=The Dragon's Nest
BodyText=Now that most of the Brood of Kerakura has been dealt with, it is time to deal the fatal blow.

As mentioned before, the dragon Kerakura resides at the top of the craggy sandstone hills dubbed 'The Dragon's Nest'. Reports state that there are a few members of the Kerakura cult that directly attend the dragon and stay in close proximity to it.

You must head to the Dragon's Nest and not only finish off the cultists, but, defeat Kerakura as well. Should Kerakura fully awaken, it would be a catastrophe to everyone in not only Dustshore, but, the surrounding regions as well.

Because Kerakura is likely to be quite dangerous, I would suggest taking friends along with you. Return to me after you have slain Kerakura and put an end to the cult's fascination with her.
CompleteText=You return safely! What news do you bring? The dragon is dead? That is great news! With Kerakura gone, we can all once again breathe a sigh of relief.

Friend, you have done so much for the people of Dustshore. Although this isn't much, please accept one of these items as a show of gratitude for your deeds. Safe journey on your travels, friend!
