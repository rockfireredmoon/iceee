TEXT=In the days of King Wilhelm, one of the many projects to unite the tribes of Old Anglorum was the construction of a large temple complex dedicated to Gaia on the southern steppes of the Western Highlands. Unlike most temples, however, this one was constructed as a large Abbey. Many druids of the time, wishing to isolate themselves in continuous devotion to the Earthmother, began to gather at this newly built temple that was sactified as the Western Monastery of Gaia.

TEXT=For centuries, the Monastery of Gaia housed many devotees to the Earthmother. During their long isolation, the abbots and abbesses often composed many collections of books to pass the time when not praying in the chapel proper. Many more books were given to the Monastery as part of the pilgrimages of many druids of the Order as well as gifts of those druids who often chose to become a monk and live at the Monastery itself. In time, the Western Monastery of Gaia amassed a vast collection of books and tomes that came to rival even the largest libraries in Anglorum and even mainland Europe.

TEXT=It isn't known exactly when the Western Monastery of Gaia began to wane in popularity and influence. Some believe it began soon after the Great Plague and the subsequent Faerie Invasion of Anglorum. Others believe the inhabitants of the Monastery survived both of these due to their isolation and very strict living habits and that the Monastery's influence didn't begin to wane until some decades to centuries later. What is known for certain is that the Order of Gaia officially closed the Monastery mere decades after the incident known to us as the 'Cleansing' which robbed Beastkind of many of the Gods. After this, the Monastery was abandoned for a time.

TEXT=Off and on in the centuries that followed the Cleansing, various groups took residence in the now mostly abandoned Monastery. One of these groups, barely a century after the Order of Gaia had left the place, was a rather sinister cult that relied on Beast sacrifice for their grizly rituals. Led by a mad Beast calling himself Kareth the Creator, this cult, assisted by Kareth's associates Kizzit and Barenthal, conducted acts of cannibalism among many other horrors.
[PAGE]
TEXT=The Order of Gaia was horrified upon discovery of the activities of the cult led by Kareth and his associates. They led a force of druids into the old Monastery and slew the entire cult. Disgust turned to revulsion and the Order druids decreed that the Monastery grounds was officially defiled beyond cleansing and they completely abandoned the site for the last time. Another couple centuries passed and another cult took up residence in the abandoned Monastery. This new cult was a cult of Mages with dark purpose. Using an old tome placed on the altar as a focus, they performed dark rituals in the old Monastery chapel. This cult, too, was discovered eventually and the King ordered them wiped out.
[PAGE]
TEXT=Once more, the long abandoned Monastery remained vacant until a brand new group of cultists came to inhabit the place in the more recent past. At first, they seemed to be just a bunch of mostly harmless fanatics; however, this new cult crying doom and woe has begun to attract the attention of more than a few in a less than peaceful manner. It's leader, Meandra, is claimed to have been inciting her followers to a number of heresies that has even drawn the ire of the Order of Gaia itself.
