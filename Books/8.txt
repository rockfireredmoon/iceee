Gyta and I began our journey three days past as requested by the Guild. Surely the rumors regarding that old cave by the coast are wrong. Either way, we are both adventurers and the prospect that a new opening has been discovered is too tempting to ignore. Because the Mayor himself sent us personally, the two of us will do our utmost to investigate this new section of the cave. We should reach the cave by tomorrow.

Worse, the entire countryside along the coast has become infested with these horrible abominations that can only be called 'wolf' in someone's worst nightmares. Gyta and I have made camp by the cave entrance and will explore it on the morrow. It took us the entire day just to fight our way to the coast. If that isn't enough, there's this bloodcurdling howl that has been emanating from within the cave itself. Hopefully we can get to sleep tonight…
