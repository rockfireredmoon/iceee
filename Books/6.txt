TITLE=Underhenge Tome

[PAGE]
TEXT=Stonehenge has been a focal point for Druidic magic in Old Anglorum since the Age of Legend. Much of what was previously known about Henge travel was lost during the tumultuous time just prior to the Age of Man, yet, this same knowledge was blessedly preserved in the texts hidden in the Library of Athena deep within Mount Olympus. Stonehenge, which had been left to ruins through the Age of Man, was painstakingly restored mere decades following the Beasts' return to Earth in the Reclamation.

TEXT=Sometime prior to King Wilhelm's unification of the peoples of Anglorum, a group of druids who worshipped Gaia excavated a series of tunnels and passageways beneath Stonehenge and built a sizable temple there. This temple complex was called the Temple Under the Stone Henge in its early days before pilgrims later shortened this name to simply the Underhenge Temple.

TEXT=It is said many complex rituals to focus and hone druidic power were often held in the temple beneath Stonehenge during the height of its time. Evenutally though, the Gaian druids began to notice a disturbing trend within the very foundations of the Underhenge temple. The very hill upon which Stonehenge itself stood, and within which lay the Underhenge, was slowly shifting. In time, the druids came to realize their temple was no longer safe and subsequent efforts to shore it up proved ineffective. After several centuries of continuous use by the druids of Gaia, Underhenge was eventually abandoned in favor of more stable surface temples.

TEXT=Decades following the abandonment of the Underhenge temple, several other groups attempted to utilize the site in the hopes of gaining whatever mystic power supposedly still lay within the underground complex. Realizing the place was just too dangerous over time, these groups would eventually follow the example of the original occupants and abandon the site. Eventually, the druids came to reclaim the Underhenge site, if for no other reason than to make certain no other parties entered it. Even today, though the Underhenge is not used by the Order of Gaia, the Order druids are considered the site's custodians.
