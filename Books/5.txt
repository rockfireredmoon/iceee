TEXT=This massive underground mausoleum complex was built following the death of King Wilhelm, Anglorum's first king as a united country. It is said many of Wilhelm's subjects, along with two notable figures of his court, were later interred here as well. Wilhelm came to power during a great tumult amongst the peoples of the large island and, using both his influence and prowess, brought them all to heel under his rule, uniting them as one for the first time in history. Following his death, Wilhelm's body was kept in the local Temple until the massive complex that was to be his tomb was completed. It was then placed in the deepest portion of the Crypt in a place of high honor befitting one of his status.

TEXT=Commander Adalhelm is said to have been King Wilhelm's most trusted soldier, eventually attaining the rank of Captain of the Royal Guard over time. Of all of Wilhelm's soldiers, Adalhelm proved the mightiest and it is believed he was never bested in battle by his foes. Rumor does have it though, that following Wilhelm's death, Adalhelm, grief stricken that he could not save his king from death, hung up his arms and returned to his family broken. When he eventually followed his liege to the afterlife, the people of Anglorum laid him to rest in the same tomb as the king he served in life.

TEXT=Among King Wilhelm's subjects was a rather notable assassin by the name of Karreth Barrington. Legend has it that the guild of assassins under Barrington's leadership was secretly Wilhelm's eyes and ears in a time when the people of Anglorum were just barely getting accostomed to working together as one nation. One tale claims that Karreth would eventually earn a spot in Wilhelm's court as one of his advisers; however, unlike others of nobility, the unusually honorable assassin chose to hone his craft rather than revel in wealth. Because of this odd trait, Karreth eventually became a close friend to the king in spite of his profession. As with Adalhelm, Karreth Barrington would earn a spot in the same Crypt as his king once the rather honorable assassin passed to the afterlife.

TEXT=One notable legend regarding the mausoleum now known to history as the Crypt of King Wilhelm involves the circumstances of its construction. It is believed that work on the Crypt began long before Wilhelm died, yet was not completed until the year following his death. The reasons as to why it was to be so expansive is believed to be that Wilhelm had commissioned a massive family crypt fully expecting to produce a long dynastic line. Unfortunately for Wilhelm, this would not come to pass and his lineage was short lived, to be replaced by the Lutharian line of kings.

TEXT=The Crypt complex faces east deep into the hill from which it was excavated and is divided into three primary wings: the North Wing, the South Wing and the Central Wing. The North Wing is where King Wilhelm was interred. It is believed Wilhelm intended for his progeny to also be placed here in due time, but this did not happen. The South Wing was reserved for other nobility while the Central Wing was where the fallen soldiers of Wilhelm's army were laid to rest.

TEXT=The Crypt of King Wilhelm is the focal point of the Camelot Graveyard located north of the great City itself and is the largest mausoleum there. Centuries of burials in the Graveyard have filled the large cemetery, yet the grandeur of the resting place of the City's own founder has yet to be matched.
