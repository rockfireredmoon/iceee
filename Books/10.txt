TEXT=Once a lesser noble house, the VonGrubers gained notoriety while defending the ill-fated Otto family in a civil war in which the Otto family, for a time, gained the regent's throne. As supporters of the Ottos, the VonGruber family patriarch of the time was granted the title of 'Baron'. After the Emberson family regained the regency two generations later, the now established VonGruber Barony was permitted to remain as part of the effort to fully reunite the felines of New Badari who were tired of civil wars.
