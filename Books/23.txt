TITLE=The Dragon's Nest Memo

[PAGE]
TEXT=High atop the windswept, sand blasted plateaus of Dustshore sits a massive dragon skeleton. For some reason, one of the larger hills on which this skeleton rests has become known by the rather dubious moniker "The Dragon's Nest". Rumors abound that a very much living dragon has taken up residence in the Nest, resting among the bones of its long dead kin.
